      <i>At Sea&mdash;March 28th.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS evening I told
      Sir Robert What's-His-Name he was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite right in this. He is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening since the ship left Vancouver he has presided over the round
      table in the middle of the smoking-room. There he sips his coffee and
      liqueur, and holds forth on every subject known to the mind of man. Each
      subject is his subject. He is an elderly person, with a bad face and a
      drooping left eyelid. He wears a monocle; and carries his handkerchief in
      his left sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell me that he is in the British Service&mdash;a judge somewhere
      down in Malaysia, where they drink more than is good for them. I believe
      it. He tosses about his <i>obiter dicta</i> as if he were pope of the
      human intellect. A garrulous pope. Surely the mind of a judge, when
      exposed, is a dreadful thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Go where I will, of an evening, there is no peace for me. In the “social
      hall” some ungoverned young thing is eternally at the piano&mdash;“On the
      Mississippi” and “The Robert E. Lee” and the other musical literature of
      the turkey trot. I could not possibly sit five minutes there without
      shrieking. Outside, on deck, it has been raw and chill for a week, with
      rain penetrating my clothing and misting the lenses of my spectacles and
      rousing my slumbering rheumatism. And you can not sit long in a stuffy
      cabin, with the port screwed fast; it is unpleasant enough sleeping
      there.... So I have huddled myself each night in a corner of the
      smoking-room. I have played at dominoes. I have played at solitaire with
      cards. <i>And I loathe games!</i> But anything is a relief that will
      divert my mind, even for an instant now and then, from thoughts of that
      loose, throaty voice, and of the truly awful mind that animates it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the passengers ever give me more than a nod; for I am not what is
      called a “mixer.” Except the Port Watch. He has looked confidingly at me
      twice over his siphon. But I have not encouraged him, for he has an
      over-intense eye and the flush of drink is on his cheek. Every day, hours
      on end, he paces the deck; hence his nickname. He is, like myself, a
      lonely man; and a little wild&mdash;distinctly a little wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert outdid himself this evening. No man could possibly know so
      much. I have made a list (not complete, of course) of the subjects on
      which he speaks with dogmatic authority&mdash;very positive, very
      technical, with a glib use of catch phrases, with emphasis always on the
      peculiarly significant point in the matter. The list runs:
    </p>
    <p>
      Aëronautics; the American temperament as affected by immigration; archery;
      art; ballistics; dog-breeding; engineering (civil and military);
      ethnology; folk-lore of all nations; geology; horticulture; inferiority of
      Latin peoples (particularly the French); laces and embroideries; modern
      accounting; navigation (which he explained last night in detail to the
      Chief Officer, a silent person); psychology (all branches); Roman law;
      rugs (and textiles generally); <i>Weltpolitik</i>; wireless telegraphy;
      and, at all times and places, the glory of England and the superiority of
      English blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening he was dismissing, with a torrent of apparently precise
      ethnological and historical data, the recent Japanese pretension to Aryan
      origin&mdash;doubtless for the benefit of that little Japanese commercial
      agent with bad teeth who sat in the corner opposite me working out
      problems on a go-board. The usual group of weak-minded persons were
      sitting about Sir Robert's table, listening with the usual awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I rather like that Japanese. Only this morning he was so kind as to
      sing several examples of the folk-song of his country into my phonograph.
      Five records he gave me, so that my work is begun even before we land.
      Excellent specimens, two of them, of the Oriental tone sense, with
      observably different intervals for the ascending and descending scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      He exhibited no sign that Sir Robert's talk annoyed him; quietly went on
      placing the little black and white shells on the board. (It is interesting
      to note, at this point, that the Japanese handle small objects with the
      first three fingers only, without employing the thumb as we do.) But I
      felt myself becoming angry. My forehead grew hot and flushed, as it always
      does when I am stirred. I tried to calm myself by constructing a house of
      dominoes; but the pitching of the ship overturned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still that throaty voice. “Thank God,” I thought, “in another day we shall
      be at Yokohama!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to read a four-weeks-old copy of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.
      No use; the voice held me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me, as an exercise in self-control, to interest myself in
      speculating on the emotions and the characteristics back of the faces here
      in the smoking-room. I achieved some success at this exercise. Why, when
      you come to think of it, should each particular unit in this haphazard
      assemblage of men and women be journeying away off here to the other side
      of the earth? There are surely dramas in our little company. The two
      middle-aged ladies with the firm chins, for instance, who dress so quietly
      and speak so discreetly&mdash;it is whispered among the men that they are
      high and prosperous in a sad business on Soo-chow Road, Shanghai. And the
      young German adventurer with the scars across his nose, who borrowed
      fifteen dollars from me, to be repaid when we land at Yokohama&mdash;if he
      approaches me again I shall refuse him firmly. And the fat vaudeville
      manager from Cincinnati, who plays fan-tan every night with a heap of
      Chinese brass <i>cash</i> and a bowl borrowed from the ship's dining-room!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I mused, I felt the Port Watch gazing at me again over his siphon. I
      believe he would pour out his story, were I to permit it. But I do not
      choose to hear. After all, I am not a romancer, but a scientific man. My
      concern is not with the curious and personal tangle of human affairs, but
      with impersonal fact and sober deductions therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert was now defining culture as the touchstone of civilization&mdash;from
      the British point of view, of course. God, that voice! And then, without a
      thought in my head as to where the talk was leading&mdash;suddenly&mdash;he
      plumped squarely down on my subject. It was the first time in the twelve
      days of our voyage. Until this moment, the tribal god referred to in his
      national anthem had spared him. <i>My subject!</i> The one thing I know
      more about than any other human being. I had him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The surest test of the culture of a people,” said he, <i>ex cathedra</i>,
      “is the music of that people. Primitive races invariably express their
      emotions in primitive music. They try to tell me that the Chinese are a
      civilized people. 'Very well,' I say then; 'let me hear their music.' No
      nation has progressed far along the great highroad of civilization without
      coming into an understanding of the diatonic system. The Chinese
      civilized? When their finest musical instrument is the little <i>sheng</i>,
      a crude collection of twelve pipes that are not even in tune? When they
      have failed to arrive at even a rudimentary perception of tonality and
      scale relationships? No; I tell you, the Chinese civilization is to the
      European as the little <i>sheng</i> is to the grand piano. The piano, on
      which all scales are related, all harmomes possible, is the supreme
      artistic achievement of the highest civilization.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough. I got right up and went over to the round table. My
      forehead was burning; I must have been red as fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do not know what you are talking about,” I cried out. I had to lean
      over the shoulder of one of the weak-minded in order to catch Sir Robert's
      eye. “It is the piano that has killed music in Europe! The piano is a lie
      from end to end of the keyboard. Bach confirmed that lie with his
      miserable triumph of the well-tempered clavichord. And in finally
      fastening his false scale upon us he destroyed in us the fine ear for true
      intervals that is to-day found only in your primitive peoples. The Chinese
      have it. The Javanese have it. The Siamese, most wonderful of all, have a
      true isotonic scale. But we of the <i>cultured</i> West (I put a wonderful
      sneering emphasis on that word) can not even <i>hear</i> true fluid music
      to-day, because our tone perception goes no farther than the barbarous
      mechanical compromise of the piano keyboard. You do not know what you are
      talking about. You are a fool!”
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am excited my voice rises and becomes shrill. I talked rapidly, so
      that no one could interrupt. And the weak-minded ones sank back in their
      chairs. They were actually afraid, I think now. In fact, when I paused the
      whole smoking-room was still as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I swept my eye about&mdash;commandingly, I think. The fat vaudeville man&mdash;he
      sat behind Sir Robert&mdash;was grinning at me with delight in his eyes,
      and was softly clapping his hands behind the fan-tan bowl. The Port Watch
      with red face and suddenly twinkling eyes, had clapped his hand over his
      mouth as if to smother an outright laugh. Sir Robert was looking up at me,
      his left eyelid drooping, a sort of perplexed uncertainty on his face&mdash;his
      old face that was all lines and wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I had the floor, it seemed worth while to make a thorough job of
      it, so I swept on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You make the piano the test of civilization. Greece had a civilization&mdash;where
      were the pianos of Greece? Oh, I am tired of your talk. I have listened to
      you for twelve long days and nights. I have suspected your accuracy, but I
      could not be sure, for you luckily avoided <i>my</i> subject. But now I
      have you! And I know you for a fraud on all subjects! I see confusion in
      your face. You are groping for something to say about the music of Greece.
      Very well; I will say it for you. The Greeks had no piano, because they
      had no harmony. They did not know that harmony was possible. And if they
      had heard it, they would not have liked it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” cried Sir Robert, flushing under the parchment of his skin, and (I
      must say) taking up the gage of battle, “but Greece gave us our diatonic
      system. The root of our scale, the tetrachord, came to us from the
      Greeks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed him down. The intervals of that Greek tetrachord were not the
      same as ours. They used intervals that actually can not be written in our
      notation&mdash;three quarter tones, one and a quarter tones. Pythagoras
      states, 'The intervals in music are rather to be judged intellectually
      through numbers than sensibly through the ear.' For they followed the
      acoustic laws, <i>like the Chinese!</i> The fragments we have of the
      worship of Apollo are more nearly like the ancient Confucian hymn than
      like anything known in modern music. “Tell me, sir, did you know that? And
      tell me this&mdash;does not the quality you call 'culture' imply that we
      should seek sympathetically for the standpoint of other minds? Has it
      never occurred to you that when Oriental music sounds absurd and out of
      key to you, it is your own ear that is at fault&mdash;that the intervals
      are too fine and true for your false, piano-trained sense? For such is the
      fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shaking my finger under his nose, so closely that he had to lean
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I will tell you,” I added, standing right over him, “that the Chinese
      <i>sheng</i> has seventeen pipes, not twelve.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” he broke in, “but the other pipes are mute.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two are mute,” I replied triumphantly. “And two are duplicates of others.
      The correct number of speaking pipes is fifteen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were kindling now. “See here!” he cried. “Who and what are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am a banker!” I shouted&mdash;the first thing that came to my tongue.
      Then I turned and walked straight out on deck. It was precisely the moment
      for leaving; even the weak-minded could see that their oracle was tripped.
      Besides, I had to be alone. For I was breaking into a profuse sweat. The
      drops were running down my forehead into my eyes and clouding my
      spectacles; I had to take them off and carry them in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      My under lip was quivering so that my teeth chattered. And my heart was
      palpitating, and skipping beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wet and wild and dark out there on deck; but in my intense moods I
      like the rough, elemental thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood right up to the storm, clinging to the weather-rail. The ship
      rolled away down, then away up, until I could see only the dim, scurrying
      clouds. The rain beat into my face. I felt happy, in a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand came down on my shoulder. I sprang away, and turned. I dislike
      exceedingly to have any one lay hands on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Port Watch. He had put on a long raincoat, and a cap that was
      pulled low on his forehead. Under it I could see his eyes shining in a
      nervous, excited way. He certainly is a wild man, if there ever was one.
      But then I saw that he was grinning at me, and felt relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You sure did hand it to the old cock,” he said, shouting against the
      storm. “It was great. I don't know a dam' thing about music. But I know
      when a bluff is called. He's gone below.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said I, for there was no need of being uncivil to the man, “I got
      sick of his voice. And then, he was wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any one could see that,” chuckled the Port Watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked around together to the lee side of the ship, so that he could
      light a cigar. And while I did not like his taking my arm, still he seems
      to be a decent fellow enough, after all. We exchanged cards. He is
      connected with a Stock Exchange house in New York. He is a big, vigorous
      man, surely not past his middle thirties. I rather envy him his strength,
      I am so thin and frail myself. He is one of those who know nothing of what
      we weaker ones go through who have to husband our energies. A rather
      primitive person, I should say. He occupies one of the high-priced cabins
      on the promenade-deck, with a private bath. It must be pleasant to travel
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we parted at the after stairway, I said: “I did n't think I should
      like you. Shall I tell you why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because you drink too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he stood still, his hands plunged into the pockets of his
      raincoat, chewing his under lip. Finally he said, with a break in his
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You're right there. I <i>am</i> drinking too much. But&mdash;God, if you
      knew!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without so much as a good night, he plunged off down the passage
      toward that comfortable room of his, with bath. And I went below to my
      stuffy cabin, where the port has been screwed fast for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name is Crocker, Archibald Crocker, Jr., son of the well-known and,
      truth to tell, rather infamous millionaire and manipulator of stocks. Our
      worlds lie wide apart, his and mine. I realized that much when he looked
      at my card. The name of Anthony Ives Eckhart conveyed nothing to him&mdash;the
      name that is known and respected by Boag and the great von Stumbostel of
      Berlin, by de Musseau, Ramel, and Fourmont at Taris, by Sir Frederick
      Rhodes of Cambridge; the name that spells anathema to that snarling
      charlatan, von Westfall, of Bonn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker has offered to guide me through the Yoshiwara district at Yokohama
      to-morrow evening. He says that the music will interest me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I shall go with him. He says that every traveled white man in the
      world has been to “Number Nine”&mdash;that it is a legitimate, even
      necessary part of a man's experience. Certainly I do not wish to appear
      unmanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My room proved intolerable, and I was still too excited to rest; so I came
      back to the deserted smoking-room to write up my journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very late. The steward is hovering anxiously about, yawning now and
      then. I may as well let the poor fellow get to his berth. God knows, he
      sees little enough of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first I will have him fetch me a mug of their wonderful English stout.
      I find that this is even better than ale for inducing sleep. At least, in
      my own case.

    <h2>
      <i>Yokohama, Grand Hotel, March 20th.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was past three
      o'clock to-day when the ship came to anchor and the steam tender brought
      us ashore. It interested me to see the rickshaws with their bare-legged
      coolies. By the time we had ridden along the Bund to the hotel and secured
      our rooms it was four o'clock. We went down to the “lounge,” Crocker and
      I, and had tea brought in. Or I did. He drank a whisky and <i>Tan San</i>.
      Then pretty soon he drank another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several couples from the ship were about, but not many of the men who were
      traveling alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are they all?” I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who?” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The men from the ship. Have they gone to other hotels?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some of them&mdash;perhaps,” he replied. Then he looked away and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when I talk with a hard, practical man of the world, I find
      myself feeling vaguely out of it all. My life, devoted as it is to the
      discovery and classification of facts, is certainly a practical life; yet
      I seem to dwell aside from the main current. I do not quite catch the
      point of view of a rough-handed rich man like Crocker. And when I speak my
      mind, as I always endeavor to do, men do not resent it. I do not
      understand this. Come to think of it, I was decidedly outspoken last night
      with Sir Robert. He should have struck me; at least, he should have
      exhibited some anger. He would have struck Crocker, I think, in such a
      case&mdash;or jailed him for contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lingered nearly an hour over our tea and whisky. The experience was
      wholly new to me&mdash;comfortably seated in a large European hotel, with
      English folk and Americans all about, and yet with Japanese servants, and
      yellow, shrewd little Oriental faces behind the desk, and a Chinese
      cashier in a blue rote, and Chinese tailors pressing in on one, samples on
      arm, offering to make suits of clothes overnight. And out the window,
      floating about the glittering harbor, sampans and a great Chinese junk or
      two, and the fleet of fishing-boats with ribbed sails just skimming in
      between the breakwaters. We were the West, we and our absurdly Anglo-Saxon
      hotel; but all about us were hints and flavors of the eternal East.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I realized that Crocker had been for quite a little time twisting
      restlessly in his armchair. I looked at him now. He was tapping the carpet
      softly but very rapidly with his right foot, and rubbing his chin with his
      hand. Crocker's chin is of good size and shape, the sort we usually speak
      of as “strong.” He is a dark man, inclined to fullness in the face and
      figure, but still athletic in appearance. His eyes are brown. He is not at
      all a bad-looking fellow, when you study him out. I rather like the blend
      in him of vigor, and perhaps stubbornness, with frankness. I should say
      that apart from the abnormal experiences, whatever they may be, that have
      driven or drawn him to this part of the world, he is a man of will and
      spirit. He would fight, I think, in a pinch. When fully himself, in his
      own home and business environment, he must be a man's man. He is nearly a
      head taller than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught me looking at him, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he, “shall we go along?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On that little expedition we spoke of last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” I remembered now. “But&mdash;is n't it&mdash;do we want to go to
      such a place now&mdash;in the day-time?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyebrows. “You old sybarite!” he chuckled, and hummed, “<i>Et
      la nuit, tous les chats sont gris!</i>” Then he added, more seriously:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But really, Eckhart, three ships are in to-day&mdash;the Pacific Mail and
      the French finer besides ours&mdash;and if we wait until evening we shall
      have no choice at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well,” said I then, briskly, for I do not like to be ridiculed.
      “Just wait until I can get my phonograph.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your <i>what?</i>” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My phonograph,” I repeated, with dignity. And I went upstairs for ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came down, with the heavy instrument in its case under one arm and
      a box of new record cylinders under the other, he was not in the lounge. I
      passed on out to the porch, and found him there with two rickshaws
      waiting. When he saw me with my heavy burdens, he began laughing in that
      nervous, jumpy way he has. But I ignored him, and placed the boxes
      carefully in my rickshaw. We were about to start when I realized that I
      had forgotten my record-taking horn, so I went back for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look here, old man,” said Crocker, from his rickshaw, when I reappeared,
      “it's all right, of course,&mdash;I don't mind,&mdash;but what on earth
      are you bringing all that junk for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were so good as to explain that I would find the music interesting,”
      I replied. “You surely don't suppose that I trust my ear in this delicate
      research work. Why, my dear fellow, in my studies of our American Indian
      songs I have succeeded in recording intervals as close as the sixteenth
      part of a tone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still grinning. “All right,” he said; “don't get stuffy. I'll be
      good. Hop into your rickshaw.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so. The coolies turned for directions. Crocker was about to give
      them when two of our fellow passengers, accompanied by their wives,
      stepped out of the hotel. Crocker waited, and we sat there, looking rather
      foolish, until they had passed on out of ear-shot; then he leaned forward
      and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Number Nine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heh!” cried the two coolies instantly, as one man, and wheeling about
      they ran the little vehicles out of the court and into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must admit that my first impression of the Yokohama streets was rather
      disappointing&mdash;that is, until we turned a corner unexpectedly and
      entered the Yoshiwara district. The streets were much more like England
      than the Japan of my fancy. Crocker tells me that Yokohama was built up as
      a foreign concession for purposes of trade, and therefore is really not
      Japanese at all. But once in the Yoshiwara quarter my nerves began to
      tingle; for this was a bit of Japan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker insists that it is small and tawdry compared to the Tokio
      Yoshiwara. Never having explored that portion of the capital, I can not
      say. To me it was quite enchanting. The houses were higher than is
      customary in Japanese cities. In color all were of the unpainted but
      pleasantly weathered shade of light brown that is so agreeable to the eye&mdash;very
      possibly they stain the wood, as we do in the case of our modern
      bungalows. There were little hanging balconies on the upper stories, with
      decorative festoons of colored paper lanterns. Through the windows and the
      open doorways one caught glimpses of the spring flowers and blossoms that
      play so great and fine a part in the esthetic life of this extraordinary
      people. And here and there, at a window or over a balcony railing, could
      be seen a face&mdash;a quaint and girlish face with glossy black hair done
      up fantastically high over wide shell combs and with glimpses of flowered
      silks about slim shoulders. The fragrance of the early cherry and plum
      blossoms was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous “Number Nine” proved to be a large house at the end of the
      street. The door stood invitingly open. A well-trained servant took my two
      boxes and the horn and carried them in. Another servant guided us
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior was cool and spacious. It differed in so many respects from
      photographs of typical Japanese house interiors that I decided it is
      really a foreign resort. Later inquiries this evening have confirmed this
      conclusion. In the actual Japanese house, the floor is elevated a foot or
      more and is also the seat; and in entering one passes first into a tiny
      hall on the street level, removes his shoes, then steps up to the floor
      proper. Here there was no such arrangement. We mounted steps, then walked
      through a broad hall that led into a central court full of flowers. The
      woodwork of floor and walls was of that characteristic and agreeable tan
      or natural shade. The rugs were simple and quiet in design and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our guide led us to a stairway. The boy with my apparatus looked to me for
      instructions, and I motioned him to follow. Then we mounted the stairs,
      and passed along a broad corridor overlooking the court to an office-like
      room in the corner that was furnished with European tables and chairs. On
      the way we passed an open doorway, and I caught a passing glimpse of a
      dim, large room, in which the only furniture appeared to be a low platform
      covered with a rug of light red.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's where the geisha girls dance,” Crocker whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. I was looking forward with a good deal of interest to hearing
      the music that accompanies this performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corner room we were welcomed very civilly by a little old woman,
      and tea was brought us. Then she said something to Crocker in a sort of
      pidgin-English which I did not quite catch. He nodded eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me, with some bitterness I am afraid, that the little old
      woman would never have thought of turning to me as the leading spirit&mdash;never
      in the world. She hardly looked at me. So I went on sipping my tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened, and in came a file of girls&mdash;fourteen of them. All
      were young; one, I thought, of not more than thirteen or fourteen years&mdash;though
      it is difficult for us of the West to judge accurately the age of
      Orientals. They shuffled along in their curious little shoes. Several
      seemed to me extremely pretty; all were small and dainty. Everything
      considered, they made a pleasing picture as they stood there, looking at
      us with a demure twinkling in each almond eye. I wondered what would come
      next. A dance, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker had hitched forward in his chair and was looking rapidly from one
      end of the line to the other. His face was more flushed even than usual;
      his eyes were eager. Finally his gaze rested on the third girl from the
      right end of the line. I began to feel uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he rose, and nodded toward that third girl. She promptly
      stepped forward. “See you later, old man,” he said to me bruskly, hardly
      looking at me, and then, laying down a gold coin and taking the girl's
      arm, hurried from the room with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone there, with the old woman and the thirteen girls, I found
      myself rather confused. It had not occurred to me that the business was to
      be rushed through with so mechanically, so brutally. The beauty of the
      building and the charm of these quaint little girls in soft-colored
      costumes had up to this moment held a strong lure for me. But suddenly the
      situation rang hard and metallic. It was, after all, just the problematic,
      age-old business in a new dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I began to feel ashamed. After all, most men are direct and
      practical in these puzzling matters. They do not theorize, they do not
      shrink from rough facts. They take life as they find it, and pass on. Here
      am I (so ran my thoughts) drawing hack, refusing life, and that not in any
      firmness of purpose, but in a sort of fright!
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should like to see the geishas dance,” I managed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No can do,” replied the old woman, with a gesture of her skinny hands.
      “One day&mdash;three day&mdash;must tell.” And she held up three fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't understand you,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Geisha girls no have got&mdash;must go catchee two, three, four piecee
      girl; two, three, four piecee music. Two&mdash;three day you tell. No can
      do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She evidently meant that it was necessary to give notice if one wished the
      geisha dance. And she was grinning at me now and pointing to the girls. I
      was being swept along in this brutal business. Otherwise, they would feel,
      why had I come to take up their time?
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt the color rushing into my face as I raised my hand and pointed at
      random. One of the girls came forward. The old woman held out her hand. I
      found a gold coin and dropped it on her palm; then turned for my
      apparatus, which the boy had set on a chair by the door. I made a rather
      awkward matter of picking it up, dropping the horn with a clatter. The
      other girls and the old woman were leaving the room and seemed not to
      observe my confusion. The girl whom I had selected picked up the horn;
      then led the way out the door and along the corridor overlooking the wide
      court where the flowers were.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered a room, and she closed the door. My heart was palpitating, and
      I knew that my face was red; so I busied myself setting down the two boxes
      on the table and opening them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt her brush against my arm, and looked at her. She was rather older
      than I had thought, though still young enough, God knows, for the pitiful
      trade she plies. And she was smiling, with what appeared to be genuine
      good humor. Probably I amused her. Worldly-wise women, when they observe
      me at all, usually look amused; so I make it a rule to avoid them when I
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wha' ees eet?” she asked, nodding toward the instrument. She spoke in
      quite understandable English, though with a strong accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her it was a phonograph, and asked if she would sing into it. She
      seemed pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had her sing all the native songs she was able to think of at the
      moment, making notes of the title of each, as nearly as I could catch the
      sound of the words. To make sure that I had each correctly identified, I
      repeated it to her. She laughed a good deal over my attempts to pronounce
      these titles. The seven songs that interested me I then requested her to
      sing into the phonograph. This she did, with only fair satisfaction to me;
      for she laughed a good deal, and would occasionally turn her head to look
      up at me, thus directing the tone away from the horn. I had to make her
      sing four of them twice. I regretted this, as four cylinders were thereby
      wasted, and I can not replace these specially made cylinders on this side
      the Pacific. I began to see that the twenty-two hundred I have brought
      with me will be used up pretty rapidly when my investigation gets under
      full headway on the farther side of the Yellow Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have, later to-night, played over these seven records here in my room at
      the hotel, with some sense of disappointment. One of them I think will
      prove, on careful analysis, to have for its basis the ancient pentatonic
      scale. The intervals of two are very nearly those of the oldest known
      Greek scales of a tone and two conjunct tetra-chords. But in the case of
      the other four I shall be greatly surprised if they employ any other
      intervals than those of our own equal temperament scale of twelve
      semitones to the octave.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, of course, is really the trouble with Japan as a field of research;
      these marvelous little people pick up and assimilate Western ideas with
      such rapidity that their ancient traditions become hopelessly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed to tire after a while. Her voice became hoarse and she
      fell to coughing. I realized then that I had been holding her pretty
      closely to this work, and told her that she could rest a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, she sat on the edge of the European ted, and looked at me, half
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You lig hear the <i>koto?</i>” she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded eagerly. The <i>koto</i>, as I have long known, is closely
      related to the ancient Chinese instrument, the <i>ch'in</i>, beloved of
      Confucius. Many investigators hold, indeed, that it is the same
      instrument, transplanted in the earliest times and changed a little in its
      new environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped out of the room, and shortly returned with the instrument,
      which remotely resembles a modern zither&mdash;at least, in the fact that
      it has a number of strings (thirteen in this instance) stretched over a
      board and played by plucking with the fingers. It was a beautiful object,
      the <i>koto</i> of this nameless little inmate of the Yoshiwara, highly
      lacquered, with fine inlays of polished woods, tortoise-shell, ivory, and
      silver; and I could see by her smiling breathlessness and the engaging,
      almost shy glances she gave me as she curled up on the bed to play it,
      that she was inordinately proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You lig hear me pray?” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word “pray” came to me with a curious shock in this place. Then I
      remembered the Japanese confusion of our <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> sounds, and
      knew that she meant “play.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew from a fold of her dress a pitch-pipe contrived of six little
      bamboo tubes bound together by means of a copper wire, and tuned all the
      thirteen strings. Then she played for quite a long time, characteristic
      melodies of the Orient that floated vaguely and hauntingly between the
      major and the minor. I was able to get a fairly clear idea of the scale
      she used before I decided upon the nature of the records I wished to make
      of it. I moved a table over to the phonograph, and, by resting the koto on
      small boxes that I found on the bureau, I contrived to place it almost
      against the horn of the phonograph. Then I had her play, first the scale
      of the open strings, followed by those two or three of the melodies that
      had particularly interested me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had grown dark some time before this, and she had lighted a lamp. Now,
      feeling on the whole well satisfied with the ten records I had made, I
      looked at my watch, and was astonished to learn that it was half-past
      eight in the evening. I at once set about packing up my apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood close to me, watching the process. Occasionally she put out her
      small hand and stroked my hair. When I had done, she came still closer
      and, with momentary hesitation, placed her arms about my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You go 'way?” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “I must go now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You doan' lig me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, yes, certainly,” I replied, “I like you very much. And you have sung
      and played very prettily for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said she, looking somewhat puzzled, “you lig that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. My hands had dropped naturally upon her shoulders. But I was
      conscious then&mdash;and indeed, am to-night, as I write it down&mdash;of
      some confusion of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she raised her face&mdash;by stretching up on tiptoe and pulling with
      tight little arms about my neck. I did not know what to do. To draw my
      lips away from hers would be something more than absurd. There is a limit
      even to what I suppose I must sooner or later admit as my own unmanliness.
      So I kissed her, white man fashion. And, to my complete surprise, she
      clung to me with what seemed, for the moment, to be genuine emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not attempt to explain either my nature in general or my actions at
      this particular time. What would be the use? I am writing this journal for
      my own eyes alone; and, God knows, hours enough of my life have been
      wasted in the pale avenues of introspection. I am not a wholly bloodless
      being. And I know well enough that the average man buys women now and
      then, here and there, whatever obligation he may think himself under to
      conceal the fact and thereby contribute his support to the immense
      foundation lie on which our Anglo-Saxon structure of virtue and morality
      rests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why I found myself unable to stay. Perhaps in another place
      and at another time 't would have been different. Perhaps the beauty and
      charm of the house and the pleasant attractiveness of the little person
      herself had raised me too high above the ordinary sordid plane of this
      transaction, and emphasized the ugliness of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, too, the fact (extraordinary in my lonely experience) that she
      had given up smiling at me, and now plainly wanted me to stay, was among
      the curious psychological forces that drove me away. As to <i>why</i> she
      wanted me, I can not say. I have puzzled over that part of it all the
      evening (it is now a quarter to midnight) without arriving at any
      conclusion. It may be that by unconsciously permitting her, through my
      deep interest in her music, to show something of her own enthusiasms and
      of the emotions that stirred them, I had flattered her more subtly than I
      knew. Who can say?
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned right back to my boxes. She called a boy to carry them, and I
      went away. My last glimpse, as I closed her door, was of a quaint little
      slant-eyed person, whose hair had become disarranged and was tumbling
      about her ears, whose lips were parted in a breathless smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing is sure: I shall never let Crocker know that I came away like
      that. If he believed me at all, which I doubt, he would certainly think me
      weaker than I am. I may be a complicated, finicky person; but I do not
      believe I am as weak as he would think me if he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was walking along the corridor I heard other footsteps, and looking
      across the dim, flower-scented court, just managed to distinguish a rather
      ponderous figure proceeding slowly among the shadows on the other side. We
      met at the top of the stairs. It was Sir Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself coloring furiously; and he wore a shamefaced expression. For
      such is the curious hypocrisy of man when caught in his more or less
      constant relationship with the one completely universal and unchangeable
      of his institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said he, rather awkwardly, “it is a very pleasant place, the way
      they keep it up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very,” I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is all this?” He was looking at my boxes, in the arms of the boy
      at my elbow. “Purchases? Here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is my phonograph,” I explained, quite unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your <i>what?</i>” He said this much as Crocker had said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My phonograph,” I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking at me, with knit brows. Then, “Ah, ha!” he said, musing.
      “So <i>that</i> was it! I could n't explain that music&mdash;hours of it&mdash;and
      the repetitions. I begin to see. You are the authority on Oriental music.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert began smiling&mdash;an old man's smile. I started down the
      stairs, but he kept at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went on to the outer door together without a word, and waited while the
      boy called rickshaws for us. I looked at Sir Robert. He was still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me congratulate you,” he said then, rather dryly. And his left eyelid
      drooped in what was grotesquely like a wink. “You have the distinction, I
      believe, of being quite the most practical man in the world. You will go
      far.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank God, the rickshaw is the most unsociable of vehicles. Each of us
      stepped into his own and rolled away through a dim street bordered by rows
      of gay paper lanterns, which were lighted now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my rickshaw turned the corner, we nearly collided head on with another
      one. By the light of the lanterns I made out its occupant&mdash;the fat
      vaudeville manager from Cincinnati.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved a cheerful hand at me as we passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Number Nine?” he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Number Nine,” I replied. I felt depressed and ashamed; but he took it
      very easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have, however, confirmed a conclusion tonight, so the experience has its
      value. I shall push on to China, where the ancient music may still be
      caught in its pure form, uncorrupted and unconfused by the modern touch.
      For my purposes, time spent in Japan would be wasted. And I shall hurry
      past the treaty ports to Peking. The treaty ports, they tell me, are not
      really Chinese at all. For that matter, how could they be?

    <h2>
      <i>Grand Hotel, Yokohama, March 30th, Early Afternoon.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ROCKER has not yet
      appeared. I borrowed his key from the office, just before lunch, and
      looked in his room. His bed had not been, slept in. There is certainly no
      indirection about Crocker, no introspective uncertainty; he meets life as
      it presents itself, roughly and squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, I find I like him much better than I expected. He is really
      a companionable chap. He is not so eager to tell his troubles as I had
      thought he would be. In fact, barring that one moment on the ship, he has
      not even referred to them; and I myself drew that out by telling him he
      was drinking too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert came over and sat with me just now in the dining-room while I
      finished my lunch. I cut the meal as short as I could. He was distinctly
      affable. He asked point-blank where I am going, and I had to tell. It
      seems that he is bound for Peking also, <i>via</i> Shanghai and Nanking.
      Fortunately, he announced his route before asking about mine. I decided on
      the spot to go around by the Korean and Chinese Imperial Railways, through
      Fusan, Mukden, and Shanhaikwan.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he perhaps did me a service by telling me of a pleasant little
      French hotel at Peking, on the Italian <i>glacis</i>, whatever that is.
      The big hotel in the Legation Quarter, he says, is rather expensive and at
      this time of year will be swarming with tourists. The little <i>Hôtel de
      Chine</i>, on the other hand, is frequented only by queer types of the
      Coast, and is really very cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>cuisine</i>,” said Sir Robert, “is atrocious. But, being French,
      they serve excellent coffee, which does for breakfast and one can, in a
      pinch, put together a fair luncheon there. For dinner, the <i>Wagon-lits</i>,
      of course. Above all, make no experiments with the cellar of the <i>Hôtel
      de Chine</i>. They will show you an imposing wine-card. Shun it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I merely bowed at this. It was no use telling Sir Robert that I should
      certainly not know one alleged vintage from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one difficulty. Sir Robert himself, affecting a taste for the
      quaint, will be stopping at our less pretentious hostelry; again, with my
      eyes closed at night, I shall see that bad old face with the one drooping
      eyelid; again that loose voice will sound in my ears. But then, I shall be
      very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one is knocking at my door. Crocker is calling.

    <h2>
      Midnight&mdash;Still the 30th.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ROCKER was in the
      worst shape I have seen him in so far. His eyes were red. And when he
      dropped on my couch, the first thing he did was to stretch out his right
      hand and watch it critically. It was decidedly unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ring up a boy, old chap, will you?” he said. I did so. He ordered a quart
      bottle of whisky and a half-dozen bottles of <i>Tan San</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Steady my nerves,” he observed, half to himself. “It's that dam' <i>saké</i>.
      Gets to me like absinthe.” He chuckled. “I must have a quart of the stuff
      in me. Some night, my boy!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously, a few drinks of the whisky did seem to steady his nerves. After
      a while he came over to the table, sat down opposite me, and lighted a
      cigar. We talked for an hour or two&mdash;until I finally explained that I
      really had to get at my work. Then he returned to the sofa, stretched out
      comfortably, with the whisky and an ash-tray on a chair beside him, and
      watched me, with only an occasional good-natured interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed greatly interested in my method of musical notation. Of course,
      the ordinary staff of five lines would not serve me at all, since I find
      it necessary to indicate intervals much closer ===than the usual
      half-step. I use large sheets of paper, ruled from top to bottom with fine
      lines, every sixteenth line being heavier. Thus I can record intervals as
      fine as the sixteenth of a tone. In fact, as I told Crocker, and as Rameau
      and von Stumbostel both recognize, <i>I have actually done so!</i> I
      undoubtedly possess the most delicate aural perception of any scientist
      that has ever investigated the so-called primitive music. My ears are to
      me what the eyes of the great astronomer are to him. This is why all my
      contemporaries, particularly the great von Stumbostel, are following my
      present inquiry with such extraordinary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o'clock before I finished noting down the songs and <i>koto</i>
      melodies from my records of the preceding evening. Crocker sipped
      continuously at his whisky and <i>Tan San</i>&mdash;to my surprise,
      without the slightest apparent ill effect. Perhaps he grew a little
      mellower, a little more human, as the phrase runs, but that was all. When
      my work was done, I drew a chair to the sofa, put my feet up, and
      encouraged him to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little after seven he went to his room to dress for dinner. I
      scrubbed some of the ink off my fingers and slipped into my dinner-jacket,
      then knocked at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we descended the wide stairs, I observed that Crocker was walking down
      very rigidly, placing his foot squarely in the middle of each step. On the
      landing he paused, and turned to me with a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Am I acting all right?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perfectly. Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy,”&mdash;he lowered his voice,&mdash;“I'm drunk as a lord. But I
      reckon I can get away with it. Come along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He really handled himself surprisingly well. I am not an expert, of
      course, in the various psychological reactions from drink. I should have
      said he was a little over-stimulated, nothing more. He kept away from the
      bar, and at the table in the big dining-room drank very little&mdash;only
      a cocktail and a light wine with the roast. And he discussed this with me
      at the start, finally deciding that it would not be wise for him to stop
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well until the dessert. There was quite a choice of items on the
      bill. I ordered vanilla ice cream. I distinctly heard him order the same.
      I recall wondering a little, at the moment; for surely vanilla ice cream
      was not the most desirable addition to the various substances already on
      his alcohol-poisoned stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the waiter set the dish before him, he astonished me with a sudden
      outburst of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good God!” he cried, quite loud, “am I to be treated like this! Has
      nobody any regard for my feelings!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to feel unpleasantly conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is past all endurance!” he shouted, pushing back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese waiter had turned back, by this time, and stood, bowing
      respectfully by his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker swore under his breath, sprang to his feet, and with a short, hard
      swing of his right hand struck the unsuspecting Chinaman on the jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never before saw a man fall in precisely that way. Indeed, it was not a
      fall in the ordinary sense of the word. It was more like a sudden
      paralysis. His knees appeared to give, and he sank to the floor without
      the slightest sound that I was conscious of.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of confusion, of course. Women made sounds. One or
      two, I think, ran from the room. There was much scraping of chairs as men
      got up and made for us. The manager of the hotel appeared, crowding
      through toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinaman did not stir; he was now merely a heap of blue clothing at
      our feet, huddled against the table-leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker stood beside the table, steadying himself by gripping the back of
      his chair, and smiling with an air of rather self-conscious distinction.
      He bowed slightly to the breathless manager.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      “It was quite unavoidable,” he said. “As a gentleman you will readily see
      that.” His tongue was thicker now. “Nobody regrets it more'n I&mdash;nobody
      more'n I.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager gave me a look and caught him by one arm. I took the other.
      Crocker hung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is quite unnecessary,” he said, “quite unnecessary. I'm perf'kly
      sober, I assure you. As a matter o' fac', I'm soberes' man in th 'ole big
      room. Very big room. Ver' big room indeed. Bigges' room ever saw.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Between, us, the manager and I got him upstairs and into his room. Then I
      was left alone with him to undress him and get him into his bed. The task
      consumed all of an hour. He was rough, almost violent, one moment, and
      absurdly polite the next. His mind developed a trick of leaping off on
      unexpected tangents. He tried to point out reasons against removing each
      article of clothing as we came to it. It was interesting, on the whole. I
      have since almost regretted that I did not make exact notes of these
      curious mental flights. But at the moment it seemed too remote from my own
      field of study. And I suppose my decision was reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurs to me, in glancing back over the foregoing paragraph, that
      Crocker&mdash;had I been the drunk one and he the sober&mdash;would not
      have drifted into this highly self-conscious theorizing; he would not have
      felt this detachment from the fact. Perhaps that is the secret of my
      difference from other men. Perhaps that is the peculiar respect in which I
      am not wholly normal. If this is so, am I doomed to dwell always apart
      from my fellows in a cold region of pure thought? I am going to set this
      confession down here: I have almost envied Crocker to-night&mdash;not, of
      course, the frightful things he does, but the human, yes, the animal
      quality of the man that makes it possible for him to get drunk now and
      then. <i>For I can't do it!</i> I am farther from the norm than he; on the
      opposite side, to be sure, but farther. Is not this why I have never had a
      man chum?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this why no good woman has ever looked on me with the eye of love?
    </p>
    <p>
      I got him to bed, finally, and sat by him until he fell asleep. I am going
      back there now to pass the night on his sofa, first undressing here. I
      shall feel somewhat conspicuous, walking down the hall in the gay kimono I
      bought this morning. But I do not think any one will notice it. They seem
      not to mind such things out here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager has just been up to see me. He says that the waiter is all
      right now, excepting a slight nausea. And he suggests that Crocker leave
      the hotel as soon as convenient. Poor fellow, I shall have to carry this
      word to him. I found, on pinning the manager down, that by the phrase “as
      soon as convenient” he means as early to-morrow as possible. But I shall
      not wake Crocker up; he shall have his sleep before they turn him out on
      the Bund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I must get ready now for my night watch. It is the first time I have
      ever been responsible for a drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow I leave over the Tokaido Railway for the Straits of Tsushima,
      Korea, Manchuria, and the barbaric old capital of the newest republic on
      earth. It has been a curious experience throughout, this with Crocker. But
      it will soon be over now. And I do not regret it. I may never again be
      drawn so deeply into the rough current of actual life. My way lies far
      from this.

      On the Railway, Coasting the Island Sea&mdash;March 31st.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ROCKER'S story
      came out, after all. This morning, in his room. It is rather difficult
      writing here on the train, with only a suit-case for a table; but I feel
      that I must set down the last of this strange story, now that I have given
      so much of my time and thought to the man; and it must be written before
      any new experiences may arise to claim my attention and perhaps erase some
      salient detail of the narrative. Then, who knows? This may not be the
      last. I may find myself involved in it again. Sir Robert observed
      yesterday: “The China Coast is even smaller than the well-known world.
      Even if I should miss you at Peking, we shall meet again.” He is doubtless
      right. We shall meet again. And Crocker and I, too, shall meet again, I
      think. When and how, I can only wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept badly last night, on his sofa. Early this morning I returned to my
      own room, dressed, ordered up a light breakfast, and then spent two hours
      in packing. It was nearer eleven than ten when I tapped on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in!” he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had pulled an extra pillow in behind his head, and was sitting up in
      bed. He was whiter than I had before seen him. And the hand that he
      extended to me shook so that he could hardly hold it up. It was cold to
      the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments after I had sent a boy for his coffee, we talked about
      next to nothing&mdash;the time, the weather, my departure. But his hollow
      eyes were searching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who put me here?” he asked, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any trouble?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me. Don't play with me. Did I break out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to do but tell him the whole story; which I did. He
      listened in complete silence, sipping the coffee (for which he seemed to
      feel some repugnance).
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurt the fellow?” he asked, when I had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. He is reported all right this morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His chin dropped on his deep chest. He seemed to be mediating, in a
      crestfallen sort of way; but I observed that his eyes wandered aimlessly
      about the room. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose I had killed him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You did n't,” I replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He covered his face with his shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's the murder in my heart,” he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little he dropped his hands, leaned back on the pillow, and gazed
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You're blaming me,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are. But not so much as you will. Do you know what I'm doing out
      here? Do you suppose I left my business to come halfway around the world
      on a pleasure trip&mdash;at my age? Chuck everything worth while, just
      when I'm at the top of my stride? No, you don't know; but I'm going to
      tell you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I put up my hand, but he plunged gloomily on: “My wife eloped with a man.
      A man I knew. They came out here. I've come to find them. I'm going to
      kill him and her. With a knife.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must not do that,” said I. I recall now that the thought came to me
      to deal with him as if he were a lunatic, and humor him. So I said, “You
      must not do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the only thing to do,” said he, rather dogmatically. “How can I
      face my friends again if I fail? A man who doesn't even try to protect his
      home!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be murder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. “No honest jury would hang me for that. It is the
      unwritten law.” Then, as if conscious of the weakness of his argument, he
      added: “Besides, what difference does it make? Those two have committed
      worse than murder against me. It does n't matter a particle now what
      becomes of me. I loved my wife. I gave her everything that money could
      buy. I bought her an automobile for her own only last year. I took her to
      Europe. And when I married her she had never had anything or been
      anywhere. I wanted her to be the mistress of my home, and she insisted on
      sacrificing all that&mdash;and me&mdash;to her music. So I got her the
      best teachers in New York and Paris. Even left her in Paris to study.
      That's where she met him. She insisted on going into opera. I forbade that&mdash;naturally.
      I wanted children&mdash;she refused. Tell me&mdash;is that asking too
      much?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been talking in a monotonous tone; but now his voice began rising,
      and his face was twitching nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it?” he went on. “Is it asking too much for a husband to have sons to
      bear his name and inherit his property? When I saw what was going on, she
      told me to divorce her. I said, 'By God, that's one thing I won't do for
      you! I've some sense of honor, if you haven't! You're mine, and yuu stay
      mine!' Then she ran away with that crook. But she can't have him, I tell
      you! She can't have him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested that he lower his voice. He gave me a curious, wild glance,
      and fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that, knowing all this, I had no right to go away&mdash;that
      I must stay and prevent this terrible thing from taking place. I said as
      much to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” he replied, with some vehemence; “there's nothing in that. You could
      n't prevent anything. The best thing you can do is to run along. I don't
      even know where they are; but I'll find them. You can't hide long on the
      China Coast&mdash;not from a man that's really looking.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought this over for quite a little time. It was true enough that I
      could not prevent his giving me the slip. I could not lock him up or
      detain him in any forcible way. It seemed to me that I must do something;
      but as the moments passed it grew increasingly difficult to imagine what
      it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very disturbing. I helped him get up. Then, as he seemed fairly
      well able to dress himself, I went out and walked for a while on the Bund.
      When I returned I found him stretched out on my sofa, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come on in,” he said in a strong, sober voice. What an extraordinary fund
      of vitality the man has to draw on! “I want to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sank into a chair beside him, I felt once more that he was the
      stronger of us, I the weaker, even after all we had been through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked the ash off his cigar. It missed the ash-tray and fell, part of
      it, on the leg of my trousers. “I beg your pardon, old man,” he said, and
      carefully brushed it off. Then he settled back against the wall and stared
      up through his smoke at the pattern on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My hand is n't quite steady yet,” he added calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on: “I should n't have told this to you, Eckhart. It is n't
      the sort of thing a man can tell. But, as it happens, you know why I did
      it. I've been stewed to the brim for two days. I'm through with that now,
      though. Until a certain job is done, I touch nothing stronger than wine.
      Here's my hand on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to clear my throat. I managed to say huskily: “I can't take your
      hand on that, Crocker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. “Very well,” he said. “If you prefer it that
      way. It goes, however. I drink no more now. That is one thing I really
      have you to thank for, Eckhart. Until you spoke out, back there on the
      ship, I did n't realize how much I was drinking. What you told me this
      morning has clinched the business. I'm through. And you will find that I
      am a man of my word.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am glad of that,” said I, “because I believe that, with the drink out
      of your system, your philosophy of life will change. I hope it will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Eckhart. Now, see here. You have today seen deep into a man's heart.
      What you saw was not drink, merely; it was fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner of saying this gave me an uncomfortable feeling that he was
      speaking the truth. Indeed, my increasing conviction as to the great
      reserve power of the man was distressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I told you this morning,” he went on, “there is absolutely nothing you
      can do in the matter. Except killing me, of course&mdash;you could do
      that. But you won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said I sadly; “I won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I'm going to ask you to take the only course that an honorable man
      can take in the private quarrel of another&mdash;stand aside and try to
      forget what I have told you. You have my drunken confidences; forget
      them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “See here!” I broke out. “Were you faithful to your wife before she turned
      against you?” His eyes hardened. “What do you mean by that?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Precisely what I say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You're talking nonsense, Eckhart&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am <i>not</i> talking non&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, <i>you are!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had swung around, and was sitting up, looking me squarely in the eye,
      as he shouted me down. My heart sank. Mere squabbling would get us
      nowhere. I did not know what to do. I do not now know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes; I was, to all intents and purposes, faithful to her. I did as well
      as a normal, healthy man can be expected to do. Let us not be childish
      about this. You and I know that man is physiologically different from
      woman. We know that what there is of purity and sacredness in marriage and
      in life will be lost forever once we lower our ideal of woman's virtue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said I; “as a scientific man&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not go on with my protest; for thoughts of a few wild moments in
      my own relatively quiet life had come floating to the surface of memory.
      Who was I, to oppose the double standard of morality that has ruled the
      world so long!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still looking at me in that intent way. There was deep sadness
      behind the hard surface of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I came here to thank you for all your kindness, Eckhart,” he said then.
      “As for what you have heard, remember it is mine, not yours. That is all.
      Now, if you don't mind, I'll help you get your truck down to the train.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I did as he said. I am on my way to Peking to pursue my research. He is
      plunging off to scour the ports of Japan, all the way to Nagasaki, for the
      man and the woman who have assailed his honor and (what I am tempted to
      think even more to the point) outraged his pride as the head of his own
      house. Then he will go on, if necessary, to Shanghai,&mdash;that port of
      all the world,&mdash;to Hongkong, Manila, and Singapore, perhaps up the
      coast to Tientsin and Peking. And he has made me believe that he will do
      as he has sworn. It is very strange&mdash;very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the station I made my last weak protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Crocker,” I blurted out, “for God's sake, try to win her back. Perhaps
      you drove her away. Perhaps you were harsher, less understanding, than you
      knew. Perhaps you should beg her forgiveness, not she yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. “That may be so,” he said. “All that you say may be so.
      But I could n't take her back. Don't you see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” I replied stoutly, “I don't see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised both his hands in a despairing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is&mdash;-she&mdash;” His voice suddenly failed him. “She's a woman&mdash;and
      she's soiled!” His eyes filled; a tear rolled down his cheek. He made a
      queer, convulsive face; then threw up his hands and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. I boarded my train.
    </p>

      The young German did not return the fifteen dollars. This China Coast is a
      hive of swindlers&mdash;so says Sir Robert. Henceforth I intend hardening
      my heart against every man. And against every woman, above all. For they,
      says Sir Robert, are the subtler and the worse.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT Crocker affair
      haunts me with the power of a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not like this at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too sympathetic with that man. I opened the gates of my mind to his
      ugly story; now I can not thrust it out and close those gates. My first
      impulse, to hold him at arm's length, was sound. I should have done that.
      But at least, and at no small cost, I have again learned my little lesson;
      from now on I purpose dwelling apart from the tangle of contemporary life.
      It has no bearing on my work, on my thoughts. None whatever. It merely
      confuses me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, through momentary weakness, I have permitted my precious line of pure
      thought to be clouded with the vision of a strong man's face with tears on
      it. I see it at night. And, worse, I can not stop myself from hunting for
      the woman he is going to kill. The mere sight of a youngish couple sets my
      pulse to racing. I watch&mdash;on trains, in station crowds, on the street&mdash;for
      a beautiful woman with a sad face. That she will be beautiful I am
      certain; for Crocker would have had nothing less in that house of which he
      felt himself so strongly and dominantly the master. And I think she will
      be sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I study the throats of the beautiful young women I see. She will have the
      full, rather broad throat of the singer. And the deep chest and erect
      bearing. And I think her head will be well poised.
    </p>
    <p>
      There <i>is</i> a woman here in the hotel&mdash;a particular woman, I mean&mdash;on
      this second floor. Though, for that matter, there are only the two floors.
      I have passed her twice, in the hall. But the light is dim, and I have
      been unable to observe her throat or her face. She is of a good height,
      for a woman,&mdash;quite as tall as I,&mdash;and she steps firmly on the
      balls of her feet. Her figure is slim. The chest, I think, is deep. And in
      a way that I, as a man (and a man who knows little of woman outside the
      psychology books), can not explain in any satisfactory way, she conveys,
      even in this dim light, the impression of being exquisitely dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she has her meals served in her room. At least, I have on three
      occasions met a waiter coming upstairs with a tray; and I can not make out
      that if would be for any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sir Robert intimated, these other guests are a queer lot. There can not
      be more than twelve or fourteen, in all. The men are seedy, and rather
      silent. They sit about a good deal, reading the papers (copies of the more
      suggestive French weeklies are strewn about on every chair and sofa in the
      lounge), and they eye me and one another with a sort of cool distrust. The
      women, three or four in all, seem to come and go rather freely. And each
      has the eye, the manner, even the physical bearing, of the woman for whom
      the halfworld has no secrets. Then, there is a discreet, drifting class of
      transients&mdash;men from the Legation Quarter, I believe (often, indeed,
      they come in full uniform), who are always accompanied by young women.
      Sometimes, as it may happen, these are the familiar women of the place;
      but quite as often they are strangers to my eyes. And always, day and
      night, there is in the manner of the guests and in that of the little
      French manager and his half-caste clerk an air of carefully refraining
      from questions. It is as if every one said to every one else: “You are
      here, but you are quite safe, for I make it a rule never to see who comes
      or what goes on here. Perhaps one day I may have to ask the same discreet
      courtesy from you. It is quite all right, believe me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In this odd atmosphere I live and have my being. The building is a mere
      rambling collection of <i>mansardes</i>. The chairs in the bedrooms&mdash;at
      least, in my own&mdash;are of the common bent-iron variety usually seen in
      gardens. The beds are of the most simple iron sort, once painted with a
      white enamel that has been largely chipped off. The linen is threadbare,
      even ragged,&mdash;there is a hole in my nether sheet through which my
      foot slips at night, not infrequently catching there and waking me from
      dreams of the pillory and chains,&mdash;but it is not unclean. There would
      be no excuse for that, in a whole world of laundry-men. On each mantel and
      iron-legged table is an ash-tray that blatantly advertises a Japanese
      whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in this odd atmosphere I live and, in a manner, breathe&mdash;I and
      the slim, beautifully dressed woman who walks so firmly on the balls of
      her feet. Whoever she may be, she belongs here no more than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the chances are all against&mdash;yet I wonder! For one thing,
      she is alone. I am positive of this. All the other guests I have seen,
      now, coming and going. But she never comes or goes&mdash;excepting
      apparently for a short walk each afternoon, and always unaccompanied. He
      would not have deserted her&mdash;away out here. Surely a man would not do
      that to a woman he has loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait&mdash;I am forgetting the sort of world this is. There is nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;man
      does not do to woman. Or that woman does not do to man. Nothing is too
      subtly selfish, nothing too cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I mean to time my own walk with hers. I must see her in the light.
      I must observe her throat and her face.... At the thought of what I may
      see my nerves behave abominably. My forehead burns. My heart beats with an
      absurd irregularity. These facts alone appear to indicate that my place is
      not in this wild world of passion and conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not wholly unpleasant here in my dingy little room&mdash;though the
      carpet is a rag, and the door between me and my next neighbor has shrunk
      its lock out of alignment and appears to be blocked off, on the farther
      side, by some bulky piece of furniture. This door opens on my side of the
      partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it is not so unpleasant. Outside, the sun is shining. To my nostrils
      comes floating the quaint, pungent odor that has in the minds of so many
      travelers characterized the East. Over the low-tiled roofs of a row of
      Chinese houses I can see&mdash;beyond an open space&mdash;the masonry wall
      of the fortified Legation Quarter, with a sentry-box peeping above it, and
      the flag of Italy, and trees.

    <h2>
      <i>April 5th&mdash;night.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is she.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon I was revising my notation of the Japanese music; quite
      late, five o'clock or so. Suddenly I heard a voice&mdash;a woman's voice&mdash;singing
      very softly, in the next room, beyond that shrunken door and the bulky
      piece of furniture. It is a bureau, I think, with a mirror above it that
      is nearly as high as the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was singing “<i>Aus Meinen Grossen Schmerzen</i>” of Robert Franz,
      that saddest and most exquisite of German <i>lieder</i>. The voice is a
      full, even soprano. It is a big voice, I am sure, though she sang so
      softly. The impression I received was that she was carefully holding it
      down to a <i>pianissimo</i>. It is, I should say, a remarkable organ. Even
      in her softest voice there is what the great singers call an “edge”&mdash;that
      firm, fine resonance that will send the lightest thread of tone floating
      out over all the volume of sound of a full orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang the little song with a tone color of poignant sadness&mdash;as if
      her heart were throbbing with all the sorrow of the world, and yet as if
      she could not keep from singing. She has plainly studied much. The impulse
      to sing and the habit of singing are strong within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice, so beautiful and under such fine control, was not what
      suddenly caused me to leap up from my chair and tiptoe to that rather
      useless door, and then to turn to my kit-bag and fumble wildly for my
      tuning-fork. No; what excited me&mdash;for it did excite me out of all
      reason&mdash;was her sense of pitch. The mezzo-soprano or baritone
      transposition of that Franz song is in the key of <i>f</i>-major, ending
      in <i>d</i>-minor. I stood by her door, the <i>c</i>-fork resting lightly
      against my teeth, waiting for that lovely voice to descend the final minor
      third, linger, tenderly and sadly, on the <i>d</i>. Then I bit the fork.
      She was singing a perfect <i>d</i>. Certainly there was no piano in any of
      these miserable little rooms. And she had employed no other instrument;
      she had simply and naturally broken into song because she could not help
      singing. <i>She has absolute pitch!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The great regret of my life is that my own sense of pitch is not absolute.
      It is very nearly but not quite perfect, despite my extremely delicate ear
      for close intervals. Yet this young woman, who to my own knowledge has not
      sung a note for several days, and who can not conceivably have heard any
      Occidental music whatever, breaks into song, and casually and
      unconsciously employs the correct pitch to the twentieth part of a tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first thought was that it might be an accident. So I waited,
      tuning-fork in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having begun to sing, of course she could not stop. I am thinking now that
      probably it was the first time she had released her voice for a
      considerable period, and that at last she simply could not help making use
      of what was the natural outlet for her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She next hummed a few bars of “<i>Im Herbst</i>,” also by Franz. Evidently
      she is fond of the work of this fine lyric composer. This is in the key of
      <i>c</i>-minor. Again I tested her with my tuning-fork, and again she was
      correct to the minutest shade of a tone. Her voice had leaped the interval
      between the two keys apparently without a conscious thought on her own
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second song perhaps failed as a vehicle for her mood; at any rate,
      she stopped it abruptly, and was silent for a time. Standing there close
      to the door, I could hear her moving about with light, restless feet.
      Myself, I held my breath at moments. Then the sound of her footsteps
      ceased, and there was a sudden creaking sound, as if she had thrown
      herself upon the bed. But still I waited, breathless, balancing there with
      my left hand against the door-frame, the right clutching the tuning-fork.
      I was sure she would sing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did. But it must have been after quite a long time, for I realized
      afterward that my feet ached and that the arm I held up against the door
      frame had, as we say, gone to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there came another creaking. She was getting up. Doubtless she was
      quite too restless to lie down long. Again I heard the quick, light sound
      of her feet moving about the room. Then the voice again. And again it was
      that saddest and most exquisite of songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ”<i>Aus meinen grossen Schmerzen</i>
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Mach' ich die kleine Lieder</i>...”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      she sang, very low. I felt nearly certain that she had slipped naturally
      back into the key of <i>f</i>-major, but not absolutely certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was disturbing, this partial uncertainty on my part. No person in the
      world&mdash;not a single living being&mdash;has quite so great a need for
      absolute pitch as I. With that, coupled with my ear for intervals, I would
      stand as the one scholar perfectly equipped for my own line of
      investigation. As it is, I am not unlike an astronomer with enthusiasm,
      exhaustive knowledge, a fine mathematical brain, and a marvelous seeing
      eye, but with a very slight&mdash;oh,&mdash;very slight&mdash;touch of
      color-blindness. And I never before missed this one attribute quite so
      keenly as I miss it now, out here on the ground for the great first-hand
      investigation of my whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at last I had to give up my effort to place precisely the key in which
      she was singing, and sound the fork. As I supposed, she was right again.
      There was no doubt now. Not the slightest. As I have already written down,
      she has it&mdash;a sheer, prodigal gift of nature. And, of course, it is
      of no particular value to her. She is not even, at present, a professional
      singer; and, if she were, she could do very well without this precise
      gift.... I have supposed for years that I had a philosophy. I long ago
      realized that to waste time and tissue in concerning myself with the one
      defect in my equipment would be simply by that much to impair my actual
      effectiveness. But to-day my philosophy failed me, as I thought of that
      sad little woman who has what I lack, and who does not need it. I even had
      a wild notion of knocking on the door and making myself known to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for what actually did follow, I think I will try to set down just as
      simply and naturally as I can, reconstructing the curious scene more or
      less coolly as I recall it now, with my excitement spent and my mind
      reasonably steady. That is surely the best way, in the case of such an
      extraordinary occurrence&mdash;just write it down and let it go at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a little time, perhaps standing at her dresser. I
      wonder if it is like mine, a rickety chest of drawers, sadly in need of
      paint, with a narrow mirror above it. My mirror is broken in the
      right-hand lower corner; and at that point I see, instead of the
      reflection of the dingy room, only an irregular triangle of pine backing.
      I should like to think that hers is at least a little fresher and
      brighter, and that the mirror is not broken. These things mean a great
      deal to a woman, I think. I might have observed all this for myself,
      doubtless; but at the moment I was too full of the thrill of my discovery
      to indulge in a single personal thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still standing there by the door, my left hand quite numb, my feet a
      little cold from remaining motionless so long, when she began lightly to
      run over those remarkable exercises of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by striking octaves. Her voice flew ever so lightly, yet firmly
      and surely, from lower <i>a</i> to middle <i>a</i> to upper <i>a</i>. Then
      the two octaves of <i>a</i>-sharp. Then <i>b</i>. And so on, until she was
      touching, in that same light, sure way, the <i>d</i>-sharp above high <i>c</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next she sang an ordinary chromatic scale, no differently from the
      performance of other singers I have heard excepting perhaps for the
      remarkable evenness and firmness and pure, floating quality of her <i>pianissimo</i>
      tone. It was after all this that the remarkable gift that amazed me came
      to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to singing octaves. Only, as if testing and trying her own
      precision of pitch, she began striking the upper octave note, in making
      the leap from the lower to the higher, first correctly according to the
      accepted tempered scale of the Western world, then a fraction of a tone
      fiat, then a fraction of a tone sharp, then back to the normal octave. She
      played with, these fractional tones as easily and surely as the ordinary
      good singer plays with mere semitones. She actually took them in
      succession, quite as easily as she had, a little earlier, taken the
      semitones of the chromatic scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much. I could not stand still any longer. In all my
      experience I had never found a white person with anything approaching my
      fineness of ear in merely hearing close intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I can not sing them as I hear and know them. I have no voice at all;
      my vocal chords will not obey my will with any degree of precision. Yet
      here, in this queer, rather unpleasant little French hotel in the great,
      barbaric city of Peking, in the next room to mine, is an American woman
      who can actually sing the intervals that I can only hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was instant and utter silence in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must have been holding her breath. I could not hear so much as the
      rustle of her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke, in what I suppose was an excited whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please let me speak with you,” I said. “Please let me speak with you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that I opened the door&mdash;the shrunken door that would not
      lock.

    <h2>
      Hôtel de Chine, Peking, April 5th&mdash;or 6th.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>IS sometime in the
      very early morning. Peking is still. Even in this rookery of night birds
      every light is out but mine. I had to stop writing a while back and go for
      a long hard walk&mdash;around the Legation Quarter, outside the walls. But
      now I shall force myself to write down the rest of it. I shall not go to
      bed until it is done. It is too absurd that a scientist of proved ability
      and of highly trained will power should be overcome by his emotions in
      this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just tiptoed to the shrunken door that so inadequately separates
      her room from mine. I heard her irregular breathing: and, while I stood
      there, caught a low jumble of words spoken with the thick tongue of the
      sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she stirs restlessly in her bed. Even from my chair I can hear that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must tell what happened this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened her door. I was quite beside myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind it not quite blocking off the opening, the unpainted, dusty back of
      her bureau confronted me. I looked through the narrow space between the
      mirror post and the door frame, and saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid hands on the creaky old bureau and moved it aside. It was heavy,
      and it had no castors. I had to exert all my strength, tugging and pushing
      at it. Then I had to wait a moment to recover my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing rigidly, very white, holding with one hand to the bent
      iron tube over the foot of the little bed. She has long, slender fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never moved. Her wide eyes were fixed on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweat was breaking out on my forehead. A drop fell on the right lens
      of my spectacles. I took them off and fumbled for my handkerchief. Then I
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have absolute pitch!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move or speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But that is not all,” I went on, more rapidly. “You have the finest sense
      of intervals of any one in the world. Excepting myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes narrowed a very little. And she glanced toward the other door,
      the one that led into the hall. It seemed to me that her tense muscles
      relaxed somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I had put on my spectacles and, now quite myself, came forward
      into the room, she swung back a step and flashed her eyes on me again. And
      I saw her fingers tighten around the iron tube at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would n't do. I had frightened her dreadfully. Of course she could
      n't possibly know how mistaken she was in this. The thing to do was to
      explain everything to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Eckhart, Anthony Ives Eckhart,” I began; then paused, thinking
      that she, being a musical person, might have heard the name. But there was
      no light of recognition in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can not imagine what it means to me to find you,” I went on. It
      seemed to me that from moment to moment she was on the point of
      interrupting me, so I talked very rapidly, trying at the same time to make
      my voice and manner as easy and matter-of-fact as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have come all the way to China to make phonographic records of Chinese
      music. I shall make at least two thousand such records, and when I have
      finished my work will be recognized as the one great contribution to the
      study of the Oriental tone sense. For I shall secure and preserve on my
      cylinders the primitive scale intervals that underlie all natural musical
      expression.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason this explanation did not seem to get me anywhere.
      Excepting that now she looked bewildered as well as frightened. But I
      could not retreat. For here before me was a woman who had the great gift
      and who could understand. At this thought my mind began racing excitedly
      ahead. I thought of what she could do for me. And it was so absurdly
      simple, so little to ask! My forehead was burning now, and the hand that
      pressed the handkerchief against it was shaking perceptibly. It was a
      great moment&mdash;the greatest, perhaps, in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “God has sent you to me!” I cried, my voice rising and becoming shrill. “I
      <i>must</i> make you understand!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glancing again toward the hall door. I could n't make her out at
      all. But I lowered my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must make you understand,” I repeated. “To-day, at the very beginning
      of my work, I find you. I need you more than anything else in the world&mdash;and
      right now. Yet an hour ago I did not know you existed. It is unbelievable.
      It is a miracle! I must have a phonographic record of a close-interval
      scale. For years I have dreamed of securing one. I myself can hear the
      closest intervals, but I can not sing them. Now you&mdash;you&mdash;shall
      sing this scale for me&mdash;not the artificial half-tones of our
      barbarous piano keyboard, but quarter-tones, even eighth-tones. With such
      a scale, the sounds recorded unerringly on a cylinder from which they can
      be reproduced at will, we shall at last have an absolute standard for the
      comparison of all tones and scales. Tell me”&mdash;I was trembling with
      eagerness&mdash;“do you think you could sing eighth-tones? <i>Do</i> you
      think you could?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She just stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you must do this!” I cried. “You have no right to withhold such a
      gift! God has sent you to me, and I shall use you. It will take a little
      time, but we shall practise, practise, practise! There will be failures,
      but we shall be patient. My life work is to be a true science at last.
      They can no longer say that it depends on the caprice of a single human
      ear. They shall now hear for themselves, they shall make their own
      comparisons, working with our absolute phonographic scale. Who knows,
      perhaps we shall yet make the final perfect scale of eighty-one distinct
      notes to the octave. No voice has yet done that. And no violin. For no
      living performer has the delicacy of ear and muscle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I began chuckling excitedly at this thought. I admit that my condition
      bordered on hysteria; but has not a man the right to be very slightly
      hysterical in the great moment of his life?
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall make many records,” I said to her, mopping my wet forehead. “Von
      Stumbostel shall have one, in Berlin&mdash;and Boag. Ramel and Fourmont
      shall have them, at Paris. And de Musseau, at the Sorbonne. And Sir
      Frederick Rhodes, at Cambridge. The new scale record shall be the basis of
      volume six&mdash;on 'True Intervals and Natural Song.' One copy I shall
      seal in a metal tube for preservation at the British Museum, together with
      my other records. And&mdash;yes, I shall send one to that miserable little
      von Westfall, of Bonn. I shall silence him. I shall crush him. It will
      amuse me to do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped, all glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me until her lids drooped, and I could see her long lashes
      against the whiteness of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell back a step, hesitating, and shrinking a little, still clinging
      to the foot of the bed, and made a listless gesture with her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have broken into my room,” she said, steadily enough, but very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women <i>are</i> literal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was so. I had done just that. Doubtless it was an outrageous thing
      to do, but it had not seemed outrageous. It had come about quite
      naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, she confused me. I had been talking volubly; now, all of a sudden,
      I could not speak at all. For the first time I fully realized how pale she
      was. And she looked tired about the eyes, where nervous exhaustion always
      shows first. It occurred to me, too, that her eyes were very blue and
      distinctly beautiful. I never saw longer lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I stood stupidly there, looking at her. I had flown too high. Now my
      spirits were dropping fast into a pit of depression. She suddenly appeared
      to me as a helpless, pitiful creature. God knows there was little enough
      privacy for her in this shabby hotel with its thin partitions and its
      ill-fitting doors and its drifting, dubious class of guests; and what
      little privacy she had I had violated. I looked at the dilapidated bureau
      that had stood across our common door. It had taken all my strength to
      push it aside. I wondered if she herself had moved it there. What a
      pitiful effort, if she had, to shield her tired, hunted soul from
      intrusion! “Will you please go!” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid this nettled me a little At least, my coming in that wild way
      had not been a personal matter I had tried to make that much plain to her.
      Then why make it so personal! But that, of course, is the woman of it. And
      God knows I was wrong&mdash;all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you please go!” she breathed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed and turned to the door. But then I occurred to me as likely that I
      would no more than get my door closed before she would be in a frantic
      hurry to move the bureau back. And that bureau was too heavy for her, or
      for any woman. It was almost too heavy for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I stepped back into her room and began tugging at the bureau again.
      When I saw the fresh concern on her face, I nodded toward the hall door
      and said, “I'll go out that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood this. She even came over and watched me as I worked at the
      thing. It would n't move. Having no castors, the feet had caught in the
      matting. I went to the other end and pushed, but only succeeded in tipping
      it up, and spilling several articles to the floor. I let the bureau drop,
      and went down on my knees to pick them up. There was a hair brush and a
      nail buffer, both with heavy silver backs bearing the initials “H. C.”
      Then there was a small bottle with a glass stopper that came out and let
      the contents of the bottle run over the matting. And there was a wide
      tortoise-shell comb, of the sort that you pick up at Nagasaki.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put all these things back on the bureau, and pushed again. She stood
      beside me in apparent hesitation, then, as if on an impulse, caught hold
      and pulled with me. But it was no use. The matting was by this time
      hopelessly wrinkled up about the feet. And after a moment of this we both
      stepped back and looked at it. I simply had to stop anyway and mop off my
      forehead and wipe my spectacles. I was all out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment, I took off my coat and dropped it on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you don't mind helping once more,” I began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “&mdash;I'll have to lift it over those wrinkles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I caught hold and lifted with all my strength. She went around to the
      other side and threw her weight against it. Together we finally got it
      back squarely across the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I've made you a great deal of trouble,” I said, “and I'm sorry.” I could
      n't resist adding the question, “Did you move it here before, by
      yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me; then, slowly and guardedly, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, ruefully I think. “You are a strong woman.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” she said, without any change of expression, with not the slightest
      animation of manner, “but it did n't catch in the matting that time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked toward the door, with my coat thrown over my arm. It was hard to
      go away like that. I wonder why it is that I seem always to be walking
      away from women.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door I turned and glanced back at her. She was still there by the
      bureau, watching me go. I felt that she was looking rather intently at the
      coat on my arm, and it suddenly occurred to me that I must not leave her
      room like that, in my shirt sleeves. I felt the color come rushing to my
      face as I struggled into the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read in works on the psychology of women that they often tell with
      a look what they are unable or unwilling to frame in spoken words.
      Certainly I knew that she had told me to put my coat on, and she knew that
      I had understood. And so, even as she drove me out of her room there was
      an understanding between us that was not wanting in subtlety. She had even
      asked me to make an effort to protect her; and she was no longer angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had my coat on now, and was reaching for the door knob when a sound
      outside arrested my hand. Men were coming up the stairs to our hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard them too. She was rigid again, her hand resting on the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hear the Chinese porter talking pidgin-English as he came along
      the hall. Behind him sounded a ponderous step. Then came another voice, as
      the heavy step paused right near us&mdash;at my door, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, boy, this is number nineteen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a loose throaty voice, unlike any other in the wide world. I should
      have recognized it anywhere, in a drawing-room or blindfolded at the
      bottom of a mine. It brought rushing to my mind pictures of a ship's
      smoking-room where sat an old man with a wrinkled skin and one drooping
      eyelid who held forth on every subject known to man&mdash;pictures of the
      absurdly Anglo-Saxon hotel at Yokohama, and of a strange evening at the
      notorious “Number Nine” where an old man had smiled cynically at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert had arrived at Peking. He had come to this hotel. He was to
      occupy room number nineteen, directly opposite the closed door behind
      which I stood, motionless, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt momentarily ill. Which was foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what is he to me or I to him! But he had stirred a confusion of
      thoughts in my mind. I saw the face of another man&mdash;a strong face,
      even when flushed with drink&mdash;I saw that face with tears on it,
      working convulsively. And directly behind me stood the woman. There she
      was, and there, with her, was I myself. I felt the strange, rushing drama
      of life whirling about me. I suddenly knew that every man is entangled in
      it&mdash;and every woman.... Oh, God, why does she have to be so
      beautiful! And so terribly alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter was opening the door of number nineteen, just across the hall.
      Sir Robert was still at my door, swearing to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Number nineteen this side,” the porter was saying. “That number sixteen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sir Robert came heavily along the hall and entered the opposite room.
      We, the woman and I, heard the porter set down his hand baggage. We heard
      him order hot water. We heard the door close and the porter rustle away in
      his robe and his soft Chinese shoes and go off down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, hardly knowing what I was about, I reached for the knob. But she
      came swiftly across the floor and caught it ahead of me, holding the door
      shut. Our hands touched. She looked very lovely, and very tired. My eyes
      wandered aimlessly over the kimono she wore, of gray crepe silk. It was
      embroidered from neck to hem in a wistaria pattern of the same soft gray
      color. I never saw such exquisite embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't go out there,” she said, low but very positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” I whispered lamely, “but&mdash;but&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The other door,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went back and moved that cursed bureau again. It was even more of a
      task this time, as we had to be careful about making any noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I lingered in our common doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know that man?” I asked, in the guarded tones we were both
      employing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” she replied simply, “but it is quite evident that you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I lingered. And she did not drive me out. She quietly busied herself
      rearranging the innumerable little articles on the bureau. She was very
      natural and unconscious about it. There was no hint in her manner that she
      was aware of the curious interest I felt in all those intimate little
      accessories of her life. Though I find myself wondering if my crudely
      concealed masculine emotions are not an open book to her, even so soon.
      The perceptions of women are finer than ours. I have read that in the
      psychology books, and I believe it. They feel more deeply and see farther.
      And it is when they feel most deeply and see farthest that they do and say
      the inconsequential little things that puzzle us so.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the bureau arranged to her taste now, and moved slowly over toward
      the round table with the bent iron legs. There were a few books on this
      table&mdash;a little red “Guide to Peking,” Murray's “Japan,” Dyer Ball's
      “Things Chinese.”&mdash;her shopping bag, her wrist watch propped up to
      serve as a clock, and the inevitable ash-tray advertising a Japanese
      whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I lingered there, half in her room, half in mine. She did not look
      at me. She hesitated at the table and fingered that absurdly vulgar little
      ash-tray. For the life of me I could not divine what she was thinking or
      what she wished me to do. I had meant to go straight into my own room and
      close the door. But I had done nothing of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to me that perhaps she was ready to have me pick up the shattered
      mood of my musical enthusiasm and carry it forward. Perhaps she would
      respond to it now. But I could not reconstruct that mood. In a desperate
      sort of way I was trying from moment to moment to do precisely that, and
      failing. For across my menial vision was floating, tantalizingly vague,
      the flushed desperate face of Crocker, as I had last seen him, at the
      Yokohama station. If this girl only knew it, we have a common interest
      that binds us a million times closer than the mere gift we both have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see I have called her a girl. She seemed so to me at that moment,
      standing there by the crooked-legged table, slim of body, softly,
      appealingly feminine in her outlines. I found myself thinking how lonely
      she must be, and what terrors must lurk ambushed in the byways of her
      thoughts, particularly at night. I fell to wondering about the man who had
      brought her out here and left her. Where was he? Did he leave her any
      money? Not a great deal, surely, or she would not be living in this shabby
      place. And yet, sad as she is, <i>she does not know what I know!</i> I am
      sure of that. She did not see Crocker's face, there at the Yokohama
      station. She does not dream that he is scouring the Coast for her from
      Mukden to Singapore&mdash;that in his heart, where pity should be, there
      is outraged pride, and the exhausting bewilderment of a man who has only a
      code where he should have been taught a philosophy&mdash;and murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world is hard on women. Perhaps because we men run it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slowly drew my foot back across the sill, moving into my own room. I
      hesitated again, and rested a trembling hand against the door frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It broke my heart to look at her, yet I could not keep from it. I wanted
      to help her. I wanted to <i>do</i> something. I even thought wildly of
      marching straight over to that crooked-legged iron table and taking her
      two hands solidly in mine and saying&mdash;“I know who you are, my dear,
      and I can imagine something of what you are suffering. I know from a
      glimpse of you that not one of the men who will be so quick to cast stones
      at you is fit to touch the hem of your skirt. I know, too, that no man can
      so much as befriend you, without plunging you into a deeper hell of
      suspicion and torment than the hell you are in now. But I am your friend,
      and all I ask of you is the opportunity to prove it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was foolish in this, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she lifted her head and looked at me
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew red all at once, and tried to swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were quite silent. She relieved the tension by stepping casually away
      from the table and glancing past me into my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that your phonograph&mdash;in there?” she asked, her voice still low,
      and now a thought husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I. “You must have heard it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded slowly. “Sometimes it sounded like that,” she mused. “And other
      times it was like music a long way off. You played some melodies on a
      Chinese stringed instrument. They were quaint.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a Japanese instrument,” I corrected eagerly. Then I became
      confused, and knew that I was turning red again. The story of those
      Yoshiwara melodies and of the outcast girl who had played them for me
      seemed painfully out of place here. Not for anything in the world would I
      have told that commonplace story&mdash;not to this slim woman with the
      sad, honest blue eyes. For we do not tell such stories to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You spoke of the piano scale,” she went on, in that musing tone. “I never
      knew before that other people noticed that. Sometimes, when I'm sitting at
      the piano, and strike one of the black keys after playing on the white, I
      can hear all around if&mdash;overtones, and fractions of tones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me,” I said&mdash;“What is the closest interval you have ever sung?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. “I don't know. There never was any reason for
      trying. And then there was no way to measure fractional tones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is now,” said I, emphatically. “My ear. Try it. We shall find out.
      First give me upper <i>c</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I got out my tuning fork, and struck the note after her
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perfect pitch again!” I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” she replied listlessly, “I can always do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now take the closest interval you can, below the c.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so. Then the next&mdash;and the next. I would not permit an <i>apportamento</i>,
      but made her separate the notes. She sang three distinct notes between the
      <i>c</i> and the <i>b</i>-natural that, on the piano, is the next step
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I clapped my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little color came into her cheeks. She took a deep breath and kept at
      it. Her performance was not quite perfect&mdash;she got in only two clean
      notes between <i>a</i> and <i>a</i>-flat. But at that it was easily the
      most delicately precise bit of singing I have ever heard. She played with
      those close intervals with a facility that was amazing. And baring perhaps
      Sembrich and the earlier Melba, I have never heard such perfection of
      breath control (Patti doubtless had it, but I never heard her).
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped forward, threw her shoulders back (without raising them),
      swung up on the balls of her feet, and with a fine un-self-consciousness
      spun out those light, clear threads of tone. When she breathed it was with
      a quick inhalation that expanded the whole upper part of her body and made
      you forget how slim she had seemed. She became for the moment a strong,
      vibrant creature with a light in her eyes. But when she stopped singing
      that light died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come!” I cried. “We shall get this down now. We shall prove it on the
      phonograph. We shall settle that von Westfall beast forever!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And I rushed back into my own room and prepared the instrument, without so
      much as ushering her in first. This was rude of me. But I have admitted I
      was not quite myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I had the cylinder on and the horn in position she followed. She
      stood at my side, watching my hands at work. I felt her there, so close,
      and was elated. I can not describe this sensation. That it is dangerous, I
      know only too well It is distinctly a tendency to be resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On second thought, I decided not to waste any of my precious cylinders
      until she should acquire a reasonable degree of certainty with the
      delicate scale that was our goal. I explained this to her, and she
      understood. So I made her work upward from middle <i>c</i>, note by note,
      employing the utmost care to keep the intervals at precisely one-eighth of
      a tone. Over and over we did this. It called for the closest
      concentration, on her part as well as mine. I found a sort of wild
      happiness springing up within me at the thought that this woman has the
      rarest of all qualities, great capacity for work and for the enthusiasm
      and utter self-absorption that enter into all real achievement. I can not
      call her a trained worker. I would not go so far as to say that she has a
      trained mind. She needs guidance. And I rather imagine that further
      acquaintance will show that she lacks enterprise. Women of fine quality
      and great capacity often do, I think. They need stimulus and leadership.
      Imagine a man with both her extraordinary gift and her striking
      personality yet stirred by no curiosity to explore and create! “There
      never was any reason for trying,” was all she had said to that, and it was
      plainly all that was in her mind on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are incomplete creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;come to think of it&mdash;so are men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the early April twilight settled down and deepened without our
      knowing it. It was she who first noted the fact. I was writing down notes
      on my extra-ruled paper to show her just where she had repeatedly missed
      our scale by a fine fraction of a tone, and she was bending close in the
      effort to see. Suddenly she sat up, drew in a quick breath, blinked a
      little, then reached over and switched on the electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This act broke the tension of our work. We talked on about it for a little
      while, planning to get at it again in the morning. After a time she rose.
      But instead of going into her own room she moved over to the window and
      looked out across the dim, tiled roofs of the Chinese houses toward the
      walls and trees of the Legation Quarter that were darkly outlined against
      a glow of electric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had lifted her momentarily out of her solitude. Now she dreaded
      returning to it. I felt this, with a glow of exultation in my heart that
      frightened me. But my impulses were too strong to-night to be governed
      offhand. I followed her to the window and stood beside her looking out,
      while my pulse raced.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's a wonderful old city,” I heard myself saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though I did not look around, I knew that she inclined her head by way
      of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for quite a long time we were silent. But my muscles were tense.
      There was a suggestion gathering head in my mind that I knew had to come
      out. I waited, resisting it with less and less vigor frum moment to
      moment. I was afraid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally it came. I said, “I wish we could have dinner here together.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I dug my nails into my palms, standing very still there, and tried to
      breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt her relax, and move a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not hungry,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute, as I still waited, she added&mdash;“Though I don't know
      that it makes any difference&mdash;if you wish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course not,” said I clumsily&mdash;“just having a little food brought
      in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I rang for the China boy, and cleared the phonograph and cylinders and
      papers and ash-tray off my little iron table, and we had dinner there.
      Though first she slipped into her room, drew the door to, and changed from
      her gray kimono to a simple blue frock that I thought very becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meal, we sat back without saying anything in particular until
      she grew restless, and finally pushed her chair back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish,” said I, “before you go, that you would sing that Franz song
      again for me. And let your voice out a little. I want to hear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought her eyes grew suddenly moist. But without the slightest
      hesitation, without rising, even, she began the song&mdash;“Aus Meinen
      Grossen Schmerzen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was still holding her voice in. “Louder,” I urged. “Come, come!
      Sing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not resist my appeal. Out came the tones, round and rich, and
      colored with the inexpressible sorrow that is the life-breath of that
      exquisite song.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned right forward on the table. I could not take my eyes from her
      broad white throat and the softly rounded chin above it and the finely
      muscular lips that framed themselves around the tones with a slight
      flaring out that suggested the bell of a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears came flooding to my eyes. There was <i>timbre</i> in that voice,
      and a wonderful floating yet firm resonance. When it swelled out in the
      climax I could feel the sound vibrations throbbing against my ear drums.
      Then it shrank in volume, and died down until the song ended in a
      breathless sob that yet was perfect music. And after she had done, and was
      sitting there motionless, brooding, with downcast face, it seemed to me I
      could still hear those sad, breathless words, and could still feel that
      gentle throbbing against my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have learned how to sing that song,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” she replied, “I have learned how to sing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in a sort of poignant dream&mdash;I still gazing at her; she still
      downcast, with the light gone out of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, directly outside my door in the hall, we heard a man clear his
      throat. An old man, unmistakably. And we heard heavy footsteps creaking
      slowly off toward the stairs. God knows how long he had been listening
      there!
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing. Merely sat with her hands in her lap. But she seemed to
      me to go limp. Certainly her face grew slowly pale until it was quite
      white, as I had first seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should have known better,” I muttered. “I am a fool!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply at once. After a moment she rose, then hesitated,
      resting a hand on the back of her chair. And her eyelids drooped until I
      could see the long, long lashes against her white skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was n't your fault,” she said, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved toward her own room. I rose, and followed part way. “The morning
      will be a better time&mdash;to work,” I managed to say. “It will be
      quieter then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated in the doorway; then slowly inclined her head, as if in
      assent. It seemed to me that she was making an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-night,” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-night,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door after her. But there remained a narrow opening where
      the upper part had shrunk away from the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood confused, looking about my room. The table was still cluttered
      with our dinner things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got my long raincoat out of the wardrobe that serves me for a closet. I
      unscrewed a hook from the wardrobe and, climbing on a chair, screwed it
      into the woodwork directly above the edge of the door. Then I hung my
      raincoat from it. Thus I cosed that narrow opening between her room and
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went out for my walk, a little later, I came squarely on Sir Robert.
      He was standing at one end of the clerk's desk, peering through his
      monocle at the board on which were recorded the names and room numbers of
      the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an odd and frank custom, that. It is doubtless done for the guidance
      of the Chinese servants, who know us only by our numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and met me squarely, as I was about to walk by.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” he said, wrinkling up his face into a smile and pecking at me with
      his monocle. His left eyelid drooped unpleasantly. “So&mdash;you, my
      friend, are the fortunate inhabitant of number sixteen. I was captivated
      by the lady's voice. I congratulate you&mdash;again.” Then, still smiling
      as he observed my rising anger, he added&mdash;“But, my dear Eckhart, you
      must not look at me as if I were an intruder&mdash;not after the lady has
      sung like that. I could hardly refuse to listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew thoughtful, and looked past me toward the door. “Women and song!”
      he mused. “Women and song!... You are a sly devil, Eckhart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, raised his monocle, and again studied the board&mdash;with an
      insolence that was calmness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was searching for the name of the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew hot all over as I stood there watching him. In a moment&mdash;a
      second&mdash;he would find it. But no, he was looking everywhere on the
      board except in the space next to that occupied by my name. Clearly, it
      had not occurred to him to look there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved closer and peeped over his shoulder. I had not before observed
      this board, beyond noting in a general way that it hung here by the
      clerk's desk. I found myself suddenly wondering if she could possibly have
      been so careless&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was&mdash;directly under mine. <i>Her own name!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there was&mdash;“Mrs. H. Crocker.” Why she has written herself down
      so irrevocably I can not imagine. In her dreadful predicament a false name
      is so clearly indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, come to think of it, she herself does not yet know how dreadful
      that predicament is. I had forgotten that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if it is that she consciously and deliberately refuses to sail
      under false colors. Or if, as is possible, it never occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert's eyes were still searching the board. They had traversed two
      rows of names. They were now moving up the third row, closer and closer to
      numbers sixteen and eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw him start. He had found it. He lowered his monocle and
      carefully wiped it with the handkerchief that he kept in his sleeve Then
      he leaned forward and looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him give a low whistle of sheer surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could n't stand that. I hurried outdoors and plunged off on my walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in sight when I came back, more than an hour later. So I
      haven't to face that cynical, drooping eye to-night, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is pitifully indiscreet of her to use her real name this way&mdash;in
      the circumstances. But oh, I am glad, just the same!

      her body, in the way she wears her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, all day, I successfully avoided Sir Robert. This afternoon, for
      a moment, he caught me; but I deliberately said good-day and walked off.
      It was rude. But he, as an Englishman, would not hesitate an instant to be
      rude to me if the fancy took him. Curiously, he is anything but rude to
      me. I believe he stations himself where there appears to be a chance of
      waylaying me. He is even foregoing the big hotel in the Legation Quarter
      and having some of his meals here, in his room, directly across from hers.

    </p>
    <p>
      I shall now drive ahead after the rest of it. It has been a rather more
      exacting task than either of us foresaw. But she is persistent. If
      anything she throws too much nervous intensity into her work. She has
      asked me for copying to do, and even secretarial work. With her reasonably
      complete musical education she is quite competent to take down from the
      phonograph the notation of melodies and themes. She shuts herself in at
      night and works over my papers and music sheets until she is quite
      exhausted. I have tried to remonstrate; but she insists that she likes
      having the work to do. Poor child!
    </p>
    <p>
      She has told me a good deal about her musical life. Not the least of her
      troubles is the fact that it would take at least two years of the very
      best coaching to fit her for opera. She has no repertoire to speak of. She
      has dreamed of the operatic stage from her earliest girlhood. But while
      she was young the opportunity was lacking. Her father was a high-school
      superintendent&mdash;a man of fineness and principle, I take it, but
      desperately poor. Her mother, who had been a singer, died when she was a
      child, the father two years ago. And then after her early marriage to
      Crocker, her life took a new and strange direction. She says nothing about
      Crocker. What little she does tell of this more recent part of her life
      she tells in a very quiet, reserved manner, implying an understanding that
      I will display no curiosity to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she accepts me as a friend. And she still thinks I know nothing of
      her beyond her bare name. I lie to her a dozen times a day, in my
      silences. But I don't see what else I can do. Certainly I can't offer her
      money. I can't buy her a ticket over the Trans-Siberian and send her off
      to Europe to study for opera. I am foolish enough to have moments of
      wishing to do just that; but it is, of course, an impossible thought. And
      to tell her the painful knowledge that is at present locked up in my mind
      would simply shock and hurt her to no purpose that I can perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have at least one meal a day together. Yesterday we shared all three
      meals&mdash;breakfast in her room, luncheon and dinner in mine. It seemed
      the natural thing to do. Excepting the breakfast&mdash;that was perhaps a
      trifle odd. But all during the night, at intervals, I heard her stirring
      about in her room, and saw that her light was on. Toward morning, feeling
      rather disturbed about her, I got up, and, at length, dressed. This was
      about six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six-thirty I stepped out on the narrow little French balcony outside my
      window. It is less than a foot wide, this balcony, and has a fancy
      wrought-iron railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also has a balcony, and while I stood there she came out. She was
      dressed. And she seemed so frankly glad to see me, that I suggested the
      breakfast. She looked very tired about the eyes. Indeed, I am not sure
      that she does not grow a shade more tired, a shade slimmer, each day. She
      eats next to nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, each day she works harder. I am going to think out some way in
      which I can offer to pay her for this work. It is most assuredly worth
      something. As it stands now, she even insists on paying for her share of
      the meals.

    </p>
    <p>
      It has been cloudy, and when she went out for her walk this afternoon she
      forgot to take her umbrella. She is not timid about the weather, anyway. I
      have thought once or twice that she likes storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her way back to the hotel when the storm broke&mdash;not far
      from the Arcade, where the moving pictures are shown. She took refuge in
      the entrance to the Arcade until the worst of the rain appeared to be
      over, then started out again through the wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert appeared at her elbow, with an umbrella. She did not observe
      whether he had been following her or merely happened to meet her. He
      walked to the hotel with her. This was all she told me; but I am sure it
      was not quite all that occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked if he was n't a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” I replied. “Why do you ask?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said she&mdash;“it was something he said.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was all I learned about that episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem to disturb her materially. I was glad it did n't. I made a
      strong effort to conceal my own foolish anger over it, and trust that I
      succeeded. At any rate, we dropped the subject.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS afternoon,
      late, I came into the hotel from a walk in the rain and went directly
      upstairs. I had my rubbers on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper corridor was nearly dark, particularly to my eyes that were
      fresh from the street and the bright lights of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a dark object by her door&mdash;a man, undoubtedly, crouching there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped short, and watched, he had a white paper in his hand. He fumbled
      with this for a moment, then slipped it under the door, pushing it clear
      through into the room with a pencil. Then he got awkwardly to his feet,
      and stood hesitating. By this time my eyes were partially accustomed to
      the dim light, and I knew it was Sir Robert. He did not see me. After a
      moment he tiptoed heavily across the hall to his own door, just opposite
      and entered, cautiously and silently closing the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked straight along the hall, past my own door, and stood before his.
      I had a mind to go in there and strangle him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was the use? He was an absurd old man, that was all. But none the
      less, as I stepped back and entered my own room, I found myself shivering
      oddly. There was an uncomfortable pressure at the back of my head, and my
      heart was skipping beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the first time in my life, I think, that I have been seized by the
      impulse to do physical harm to a fellow creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before putting on my pajamas to-night I stood and looked at my bare chest
      and arms in my broken mirror. My chest is narrow, my skin white. My arms
      are thin. Possibly I could n't have strangled him, if I had tried. I wish
      I were strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little earlier than that, before she closed our door, I asked her if Sir
      Robert was annoying her in any serious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question made her very grave&mdash;graver even than usual. She looked
      at me, then dropped her eyes, and said nothing. But after a moment she
      looked up again, made one of those efforts to smile that are pain to me,
      and shrugged her shoulders. That was all.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS afternoon he
      caught me squarely at the clerk's desk. He extended a cigar and suggested
      that we stroll into the lounge and have a chin-chin. I observed that his
      hand was unsteady, as if the palsy had reached and touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the spot I made up my mind to face him out. I accepted the cigar, and
      down we sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked if I had attended any of the theaters in the Chinese city that
      lies to the south of the Tartar Wall. When I replied in the negative, he
      suggested that we do a little exploring together of an evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The ancient Chinese character is nowhere better preserved,” said he,
      “than in these theatrical performances. And the music, of course, is the
      pure old strain, quite uncorrupted by Modernism or the West. I can boast
      of some familiarity with the Chinese drama and music, and even a little
      acquaintance with the language. It would give me pleasure to act as your
      guide.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you,” said I, a bit too shortly. “Later on, perhaps. Just now I am
      very busy with my records.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled&mdash;all wrinkles. That left eyelid drooped and drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled savagely on my cigar, chewing it so hard that the end crumpled
      between my teeth and filled my mouth with unpleasant little particles of
      tobacco leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed&mdash;with an effort, I thought. It was not a successful
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we sat for a few moments, in silence and smoke. So men sit often in
      this queer tangle of life&mdash;smoking, smiling, speaking the commonplace
      phrases that are the current small change of human intercourse, yet hating
      each other in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I say, Eckhart”&mdash;it was a little later on that he came out with this&mdash;“you
      know who she is, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no good in pretending ignorance. God knows I am not quite the
      child I sometimes seem, even to myself. So I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked narrowly at me. I met his gaze. I was just a thin, nervous man,
      a little bald, sitting quietly there and smoking, yet all the time that
      drooping left eyelid irritated me so that I wanted to reach right over and
      tear it off his face. But I only nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dangerous game, my boy,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his assumption, of course&mdash;that to me, too, she was merely a
      quarry in the endless, universal pursuit of woman by man. Out here on the
      Coast, of course, from the point of view of the hard world about us, any
      lone woman is quite legitimate prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still studying me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I 'm wondering how much you know,” he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About what?” said I, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About that woman and the fix she is in. You know who her husband is,
      surely.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed. “He was on the ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” grunted Sir Robert sardonically, “he was on the ship. And you saw
      what he did in the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, didn't you? He nearly killed a
      waiter&mdash;a Chinaman, who was quite defenseless. But of course you saw
      it. I recall that you were dining with him at the time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was drunk,” I said huskily, as if in extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” repeated Sir Robert dryly. “He was drunk. Rather dangerous at such
      times, is n't he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but he quit drinking&mdash;after that. Cut it all out.” I could not
      keep my voice from rising a little. I felt my confusion increasing&mdash;my
      thoughts were all adrift, swept here and there by currents of feeling that
      I could not fathom.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he did?” Why would n't that old man take his unpleasant eyes off me!
      “Oh, he did? You are in his confidence, then. And of course you know even
      more”&mdash;he paused, very deliberately&mdash;“regarding his state of
      mind, his reason for coming out here to the other side of the world, all
      that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat limp in my chair, still chewing that crumpling cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert leaned back. He was seated on the leather sofa. He let his head
      rest on the shabby upholstery and studied the ceiling. In one hand he held
      his cigar, in the other his monocle, tracing patterns in the air with
      them. His hands are not thin, but the skin on them is crisscrossed with
      fine wrinkles like the skin on his face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy,” he began, after a rime, “I'm going to offer you a little
      counsel. You won't take it, but I am going to offer it. Probably, at your
      age, I should n't have taken it either.” He sighed. “I am an old man. For
      forty-five years I have been observing men&mdash;and women. I have seen&mdash;well,
      a good deal, one way and another. And the one fact I have come to be sure
      of.... You know, Eckhart, the great mass of human beings&mdash;in Europe
      and America, at least, labor under the curious delusion that the race has
      finally worked out something of a civilization. Curious, but they do. It
      is rot, of course. All rot. There is no civilization. Life is quite as
      primitive as ever. Only we have developed extraordinary ingenuity at
      covering life up. That's it. That's our greatest triumph&mdash;covering
      up! At best, it is pretty messy business. And all we can be sure of is
      that every man owes it to himself and his legitimate offspring to save his
      skin at all costs, and incidentally, to capture what little he can of the
      common booty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He made me nervous. I couldn't sit there indefinitely and listen to his
      sordid philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quick to catch my mood, and went on more to the point. This
      shiftiness is the seasoned lawyer in him, I suppose. He is pretty keen,
      after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look here, Eckhart&mdash;there's no sense in men like you and me beating
      about the bush. Crocker got blind drunk at Nagasaki, and missed the
      Shanghai boat. That night he told me the same story that he had doubtless
      told you. Or did n't he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. As he had said, there was no use beating about the bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I've only this much to say, my boy. It's the one thing I've learned
      from life. Never&mdash;never&mdash;fall in love with a woman. Play with
      them, yes. Use them. But for God's sake don't let yourself fall in love
      with them!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking with a curious emphasis. His gaze had drifted upward again
      toward the dirty ceiling. And now it was suddenly my turn to sit and watch
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't do it!” he went on. “Don't do it. They fasten their lives on you,
      they smother you. If you don't marry them, it's bad enough. If you do,
      it's worse. You are an extremely gifted young man. I do not know that I
      ever met a man with a keener mind or one that impressed me as having more
      driving, vital force with which to shape a career. You are out here now,
      right in your best years, full of enthusiasm for your work. Don't let any
      woman into your life. Good or bad, whatever the phrases mean, a woman is
      n't happy with a man until she has trimmed the scope of his life down to
      the compass of her own understanding. She has to get it right into her
      hands, and choke it. Then life begins to mean something to her. Personally
      I have come to the conclusion that I get on rather better with the bad
      women, so called. They don't expect so much. In a way they are squarer&mdash;better
      sports, as you Americans say. Remember, my boy, 'He travels the fastest
      who travels alone.'.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was becoming tired of his wandering thoughts. Generalizations are a
      bore, anyway. They are always loose, and generally wrong. Then, too, I may
      as well admit that he was disturbing me deeply, this loose-minded but
      shrewd old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look here,” I said abruptly, “you know of this obsession of Crocker's?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can't we do something to restrain him?” He slowly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don't mean to say that we can't stop a man who is bent on murder?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our motives might be regarded as&mdash;well, not exactly clear, yours and
      mine,” mused Sir Robert. “Besides, he hasn't done anything. You can hardly
      restrain a man from becoming indignant if an acquaintance breaks into his
      house and steals his wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But she is n't his property, like his watch!” I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled tolerantly at me. “In a sense, she is,” said he. “In a sense.
      The weight of law and tradition is against you there, Eckhart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Traditions are nothing to me!” said I, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They still mean a good deal to the rest of the world,” said he dryly.
      “And even the law still has weight.” Then he went on, quite as if I had
      not interrupted him. “In England it might be possible, in case we could
      prove that he had openly threatened murder in the presence of competent
      witnesses, to put him under bonds to keep the peace. But this is n't
      England&mdash;it is the China Coast. At that, what would bonds mean to a
      strong, self-willed man in Crocker's state of mind! A jealous man!” He
      raised his monocle, held it a few inches before his face, and looked
      through it at a speck on the ceiling. He even moved it around a little,
      and squinted his right eye, as if sighting through a transit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to strike it from his shaking fingers. Instead, I sat up very
      straight and clasped my hands tightly together in my lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know,” he continued, in that irritating, musing tone, “I believe
      the man is still in love with her, or thinks he is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Love!” I sniffed. “You call <i>that</i> love!” He did n't look at me. He
      was still squinting at the ceiling. Pretty soon he sighed. “When you come
      right down to it,” he said, “if a man has no right to protect his home&mdash;and
      that implies some right of control over his wife&mdash;'love, honor and
      obey,' you know&mdash;what becomes of our institutions! You see, Eckhart,
      in the eyes of the world Crocker is entitled to a good deal of sympathy.
      He took care of this woman for years, supported her in some luxury, I take
      it, gave her a much richer sort of life than she had known before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by 'richer'.” I cried. “More money?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved me back with his monocle, and went on with his argument. “She was
      unwilling to bear him children. Now, Eckhart, that is serious. She was his
      wife. She refused there to meet her absolute duty as a wife. English law,
      at least, is quite definite on that point.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was dreadful. I could hardly keep in my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And following all this”&mdash;he was growing emphatic now&mdash;“she
      deliberately leaves his home and attaches herself to another man. There is
      certainly no doubt there, my boy. That is adultery. She dishonored his
      home. She dishonored him&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, I admit, I lost my temper. I sprang up, and for the second time in
      my acquaintance with this old man, shook my finger under his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rot!” I cried, using his own phrase. “Rot! All rot! He had <i>dishonored</i>
      her home a hundred times.” My voice rang out on that word “dishonored.” I
      fairly jammed it down Sir Robert's throat&mdash;made h'm eat that word,
      letter by letter. “For God's sake, lower your voice!” said he. “<i>Adultery!</i>”
      I shouted this, too. “Good God&mdash;'adultery' is a commonplace to
      Crocker!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don't know this,” said he. Then, “Lower your voice!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I <i>do</i> know,” I answered him. “He told me himself. 'Adultery!'
      Why, millions of men commit adultery'&mdash;good men, bad men, every sort
      of men! That's what the millions of prostitutes are <i>for!</i> And,
      guilty or innocent, we all lie about it to the women and the children. Lie&mdash;lie&mdash;lie!
      I'm sick of it! I'm a scientist, I tell you, and I don't recognize lies in
      my business. There's something wrong somewhere. We're all playing at life&mdash;all
      pretending&mdash;all making believe&mdash;when we ought to be studying the
      facts, working through those facts toward the truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did I tell you,” he broke in, talking around my finger&mdash;“covering
      up!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We're afraid of the truth,” I shouted. “So we cling desperately to our
      lies, and call them beautiful. And the truth&mdash;beaten down, perverted&mdash;undermines
      us, saps us, beats us at every turn. God, it's awful!” My hand fell by my
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The worst of it is, probably the truth would be beautiful, if we could
      only find it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert again drew a long, long breath. “But what's the use, Eckhart?”
      said he. “What you say is of course true. But why make a Quixote of
      yourself? Why be a dam' fool! Society does cling to its little lie. Even
      at a sacrifice of half the women in the world. Admitting that some of our
      traditions are nothing more than outworn tribal notions, what's the use of
      beating your brains out against them. I tell you, my boy, if you talk too
      much of that sort of truth the world will kill you. And the women who call
      themselves good will lead the attack, for they are the sheltered, the
      privileged class. No, we must take it as we find it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was past all this now&mdash;past the influence of all his miserable
      sophistry. My head and hands were blazing hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So!” I cried. “You tell <i>me</i> to play the coward! Do you not know
      that every one of the great explorers into the wonderful region of
      scientific truth has faced the terror and hatred of the world in precisely
      this way? Do you not know that if those great-hearted men, one after
      another, had not cut their way through the spiritual horrors of
      'tradition' We should to-day be living in medieval darkness and filth?
      Why, Old Man, you yourself can remember when 'free-thinker' was a term of
      obloquy. To-day our right to <i>think</i> is the finest, greatest right we
      have.&mdash;Do you suppose I care if they kill me?” Again I waved my
      finger under his nose. “Tell me, Old Man, do you really imagine I care?
      Don't you know, the scientific mind better than that? Can't you see that I
      admit no tradition, no dogma, no authority. I am a scientist! I am of the
      most wonderful guild of explorers this wretched old world has yet seen&mdash;the
      guild that is exploring for the truth. Tradition has not stopped us yet.
      It will never stop us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away. “Oh, I am disgusted with you,” I said&mdash;“with you and
      your beastly, cowardly mind! I'm sick of you!&mdash;Understand that? I'm
      sick of you!” And I walked straight for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert followed me. He had to step fast, too. He put his hand on my
      shoulder, and checked me. He loomed over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatever you do, my boy,” he was saying, “keep your head. That woman has
      already wrecked two lives that we know of&mdash;possibly a third. Don't
      let her wreck yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrenched away from him, and struck out alone into the narrow, muddy
      street between the Chinese houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked twice around the <i>glacis</i> that borders the Legation Quarter
      on the north, and through the Quarter from end to end on Legation Street.
      Scenes flitted past me that I only half saw&mdash;Peking carts with blue
      covers and little window's in the sides, innumerable street merchants
      uttering musical cries and offering trays of queer-smelling foods, and the
      usual indolent, good-humored crowds of blue-clad yellow men, with round
      yellow' children playing everywhere, underfoot and out in the mud of the
      street. In the Ha Ta Road a long wedding procession was passing, with an
      ornate red sedan chair for the poor little bride, and musical instruments
      that I did not so much as observe. I saw the stiff, cowed German soldiers
      on sentry duty at the eastern end of Legation Street, and, farther along,
      the solid masonry building of the Hongkong Bank; and, down a side street,
      the great, showy, extremely modern Wagon-lits Hotel. I vaguely noted the
      walls and trees of the British Compound, where centered the defense
      against the Boxer attack a dozen years ago. I strode by the American
      Compound, at the western end, and caught a glimpse through the open gate
      of lounging American boys in their olive drab. And, emerging on the plaza
      between the great Chien Gate in the Tartar Wall and the entrance to the
      Imperial City, I came upon a long train of laden camels, just in from
      Mongolia, each with a string in its ugly nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the way I knew that the confused forces that have been tearing at
      me during this disturbing week were merging into a new line of force. I
      knew, even then, that this meant a new direction for my life&mdash;my life
      that I once thought so simply and clearly outlined, so perfectly centered
      on a single interest. Now&mdash;God knows what is to become of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Sir Robert do this amazing thing to me? I can not think clearly. I am
      that way at times&mdash;I let another try to bring me to his own point of
      view, he is more likely than not merely to rouse my own inner voices. I
      never follow&mdash;I lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it be, I only know now that I am a man with blazing fires in me&mdash;fires
      that both sear and illuminate my mind, my emotions, my soul. It is
      glorious. And terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly six o'clock when I came into my room. I observed that the
      connecting door stood part way open. This meant, I had come to know, that
      she was in, and that I was welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tiptoed to the door, and tapped on it with the tips of my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting by her balcony, sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you have a good walk?” she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed less sad. When I had tossed my hat and stick aside and entered
      her room, it seemed to me even that a smile was hovering on her lovely
      face. I could not be certain of this, for she kept her head bowed over her
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped into a chair by her, and looked at her. Yes, she seemed
      distinctly softer, even more subtly feminine (as we say) than usual,
      bending over the needle that moved nimbly to and fro. It struck me that
      sewing brought out the beauty of her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she raised her head and looked at me. She <i>was</i> smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I've got it,” she said. “Listen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a quick breath and a slight stiffening of her shoulders she began
      singing the scale upward from middle <i>c</i>&mdash;sitting there with her
      sewing in her lap. I listened closely. Heretofore she had usually begun to
      miss the eighth-tone intervals when she reached <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Now
      she took them perfectly. I could not detect the slightest inaccuracy of
      pitch. I noticed that she kept to a marked rhythm, all the way up. The
      upper <i>c</i> she held, with a sudden triumphant glance at me, and
      trilled on it, very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought me to my feet. “Come,” I said gruffly, “we'll take that down on
      the machine.” She followed into my room, explaining eagerly as she watched
      me putting on the cylinder&mdash;“You see, to-day, I realized all at once
      that I've been downright stupid about it. It occurred to me that singing
      with a rhythm might carry me right along through it. And then besides I
      just stopped fussing, and made up my mind that <i>of course</i> I could do
      it. I can do it again, too. You'll see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She promptly did it again. Again and again, as rapidly as I could put on
      new cylinders. I seized the occasion to make twelve records. Then we both
      listened attentively while I played them all over. There was not the
      slightest doubt that ten were perfect&mdash;or so nearly perfect that they
      satisfied us. And that is near enough. My hands trembled as I put each
      cylinder back in its box and carefully wrote the labels. Oh, it has been a
      tremendous day, this day!
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood right over the machine throughout this performance&mdash;and we
      must have been an hour at it. I asked her to sit, but she laughed a little
      and said she was too excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the labeled boxes were all carefully put away in a drawer of my
      bureau, where no accident short of fire could reach them, I came to her
      and took her two hands. Then suddenly I could not say anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she looked right at me, and returned, very frankly, the pressure of my
      hands, and smiled, though there were tears in her own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'm so glad,” she said. “You just don't know&mdash;I've wanted so to be
      of <i>use</i>&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      She gently tried to withdraw her hands. I released one, but, still unable
      to speak, clung to the other; and hand in hand we walked to the French
      window and stepped out, side by side, on the narrow balcony. Then I let
      her hand go, and we leaned on the railing and breathed in the sweet April
      air.

    <p>
      It was evening now. Electric lights were twinkling. Gay paper lanterns
      hung out from nearby buildings. The confusion of street cries floated up
      faintly to our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was hard to speak directly. First I told her how wonderfully she
      has helped me, and to what a practical end.
    </p>
    <p>
      All she said to this was&mdash;very softly, gazing off at the lights&mdash;“I'm
      glad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I rambled on. Which would not do. My time <i>had</i> come, and I was
      letting it slip away. It was characteristic of me, I thought almost
      bitterly&mdash;always, except in the one narrow channel of my work,
      blundering ineffectually, missing the realities of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered my forces, with a great effort. I felt sober, stem, all at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen, please,” I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly I knew that she had caught the change in me. I thought I felt
      her nerves tighten, though I was not touching her. I blundered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have come to know me,” I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” she breathed, “I have come to know you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And by this time you know just about the sort of man I am. I must assume
      that you know that, because I expect you to take all of me into account in
      what I am going to say. I know I shall say it badly. I doubt if I shall
      succeed at all in saying even what I mean. Yet, you've got to understand
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept silent; but it seemed to me, in the subtle understanding we had
      somehow reached, that she assented to this preliminary condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going to put it bluntly,” I rushed on “It's the only way I can say
      it at all. I see two facts, as regards you and me. One is that you are a
      wonderful woman. You have great gifts. You have what we call temperament&mdash;a
      silly word, but there is no other for the precise meaning. It is an absurd
      waste to keep you here. You must go to Berlin or Paris&mdash;Paris, I
      think, for the French music is the most stimulating of any today. You must
      be prepared for opera just as rapidly as possible. There is no time to
      lose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth twisted into a fleeting half-smile. “It is quite out of the
      question,” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, it is not out of the question!” My voice was rising, and she had to
      give me a warning look. “I do not know quite how it is to be managed, but
      I can see a beginning, at least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed surprised at this, so I talked more and more rapidly. “First,
      you must consider my second fact. Remember, I am speaking only as a
      practical scientist&mdash;quite impersonally.” God forgive me, this seemed
      true at the moment! “What you have done for me has a value that I dare not
      even estimate. Though my income is not great, even from my text books, I
      would gladly have traveled thousands of miles and devoted months of work
      to the securing of the phonographic close-interval scale that now is
      securely mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to stir restlessly. But I would not let her speak. “Take
      your copying and clerical work alone&mdash;perhaps, I should not say this&mdash;I
      could not possibly get such devoted and expert assistance anywhere in the
      world without paying a reasonable price by the week. Now hear me! You must
      not close your mind to what I am saying!” For I knew she was doing just
      that, as women will. I caught her arm&mdash;and her hand&mdash;in my two
      hands and clung to her. She did not resist. Nor did she respond&mdash;merely
      looked soberly off over the city, and seemed, all the time, to be drifting
      away from me. My head was burning hot. My forehead was dripping wet, and I
      had to shake the drops of sweat out of my eyes. Great, wild thoughts were
      gripping my mind, that had been so confused. I knew then that I must get
      her out of Peking, away from that ugly, persistent old man across the
      hall, away from the drink-crazed younger man who thought he could by a
      violent act restore what he called his honor. I knew that I must be equal
      to this task. I must find the way. And I must persuade her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “You <i>must</i> listen! I will not place you in my debt. But you have
      placed me in yours. You must be fair to me. You must let me help you by
      paying my debt to you. I promise you I will do more than that. But oh, you
      must be fair to me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not look at me. I had her right forearm and hand in the grip of
      my hot, trembling hands. Her left elbow rested on the iron railing of the
      balcony, her chin on her hand. And her eyes roved off over the roofs of
      the Chinese houses, over the walls and trees of the Legation Quarter, off
      southward toward the temple of Heaven that stood somewhere there behind
      the trees and the starlit sky above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more my thoughts were slipping out of control. I struggled to
      hold them, but could not. I had never in my life felt like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must not let the fact that I love you confuse your sense of justice,”
      I went on, quite as if she and I had long known and admitted my love for
      her. “That is another matter altogether. Except in this&mdash;I know now
      that as long as I live I shall want to help you. This is quite beyond your
      control, or mine. It simply happens to be so. And it does seem to me that
      since it is so, you can at least let me help you to the extent that is
      practically and impersonally fair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious how the mere utterance of those three words, “I love you,”
      cleared my mind. It explained everything. It relieved me by extricating me
      from all uncertainty of thought and feeling. It thrilled me, deeply and
      solemnly. I wanted to say it over and over and over. I wanted to take her
      into my arms and whisper it into one ear and then into the other. I wanted
      to whisper it to the stars up there, the stars that have heard so much. I
      wanted to go over to the big hotel in the Quarter, where there would be
      bright lights and tourists and gilded military folk and gay ladies, and
      say it so that all might hear and share the thrill of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My talk dwindled out. What part had more argument in <i>this?</i> My grip
      on her arm relaxed; I held only to her unresponsive hand, and leaned on
      the railing beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long, long time we were still there. Then, finally she withdrew her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her and saw that her eyes were shining, and there were tears
      on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” she murmured, “why&mdash;why&mdash;could n't we have gone on!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don't mean that we can't go on!” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked full at me, and inclined her head. To-day she has had more
      color, her face has not had so much of the worn, tired look. But now, by
      the half-light that fell on her from the window, I saw that it had all
      returned. She was very sad, very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have spoken.” she said, “of money&mdash;and of love. Oh, I wish you
      had n't!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she must have read my feelings on my face, for she put her hand on my
      arm and added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not mean to hurt you. It has been beautiful. You don't know&mdash;even
      you, you don't know. You almost made life mean something again. Nothing
      that I could ever do would pay you back for that. It made me almost happy&mdash;just
      to be useful. All my life I have wanted to be that. And they have made a
      toy of me. Or they have wanted me to do something I could n't do. You have
      helped me to do what I can do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It <i>has</i> been beautiful,” I thought. Or perhaps I said it aloud, for
      she inclined her head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has been like a dream,” she said. “I know it could n't be so, but oh,
      how I have clung to it! I have blundered so with my life... but this
      seemed real.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is real,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again for a time we stood silently there, and looked out over the curving
      tile roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again I felt that she was slipping away from me. It was good that I
      had spoken my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would stay in her thoughts. Perhaps it would grow there. Perhaps the
      magic that was stirring wonderfully in my heart would touch and stir her
      heart. I knew at that moment that I loved her more than all the world&mdash;more
      than my work, more than my life. I knew, with exultation, that I was
      plunging out into uncharted ways, where lives are as often wrecked as not.
      And I did not care. I was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her shoulder brushed mine, as we leaned side by side on the railing. There
      was sheer intoxication in that contact. I raised my arm, fairly holding my
      breath, and put it about her shoulders. I caught her two hands, there by
      her chin. I saw lights, trees, sky in a swirl of happy things. A voice was
      thrilling in my heart. I gripped her tightly, and tried to kiss her. But
      she struggled. She tried to push me away. She fought me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as I staggered back, the tears came from my own eyes, blinding
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran back into my room, and stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed. “It was in my heart to do it!” I was saying, like a fool. “It
      was in my heart to do it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped on a chair, very limp and white. She motioned me to take
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must not be like the others,” she was saying, in a desperate, choking
      voice&mdash;“you must not! I can't bear it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not think. “I am not,” I replied, low&mdash;“I am not. I love you.
      You shall see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was getting us nowhere. Her eyes were dry now, and oh, so sad and
      tired. She was slowly shaking her head at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are killing&mdash;everything!” she said. But she said it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not speak, I only looked at her&mdash;looked and looked. Then I
      went over to the phonograph and worked aimlessly over it. I think I wound
      it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still sat there, her hands limp in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she said, in a low voice that was y et steady&mdash;“I wish I
      could love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can,” I muttered. “You shall!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. “No,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you must,” I went on. “It is the only thing now. It is the one way
      out for you and me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This had some effect on her. She pursed her lips, and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a little she shook her head again, and made that listless
      gesture of her left hand that she had made that first day, when I broke
      into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something has died in me,” she said. “I don't believe I can ever love a
      man again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and moved toward her own room. On the sill she paused, and
      picked at the flaking paint of the door frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not believe it is the only way out,” she said. “You will get over
      it, of course.” Then, at the shake of my head, she corrected&mdash;“At
      least, you will have your work, and the feeling that you are getting
      somewhere with your life. I should think that would be the one great
      thing, after all. And I shall at least know that I am not hurting another
      life. I hurt everybody, that cares for me. If I could&mdash;love you, I
      should undoubtedly hurt you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait,” said I, “we will go on with our work, at least&mdash;in the
      morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She pursed her lips again. “I don't know,” she replied, as if she were
      thinking aloud, “whether that is possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It must be possible!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. “You will have to let me think about that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she closed the door, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had meant to give her my life. I had only succeeded in taking away from
      her that part of it that had been helpful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it difficult to reconstruct the hour that followed. I remember
      standing a long while by the window. Once I went to her door, just so that
      I might hear her moving about her room. But as I stood there it seemed
      like an intrusion, and I came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, many things that I might have said to her came rushing to my
      thoughts. I wanted to say them now. I wanted to go right into her room and
      say them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time my heart was beating very rapidly, and my blood was hot.
      Love, it seems, is like a fever. I never knew this before. I have always
      thought it a weakness when I have seen what men call love apparently
      devastating a life. Now I see that I must correct this judgment. For love
      is a force that operates beyond the jurisdiction of reason or will. I
      begin to think that I must expect less assistance from my own reason than
      heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
      That long, wild hour of my solitude somehow passed. It occurred to me to
      go outdoors. I picked up my hat and stick. Then, irresolute, I moved to
      the window and looked out over the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood there Sir Robert came up the stairs. I heard his ponderous
      step, more hurried than usual, come along the corridor. There was a
      silence while, I knew, he was fumbling for his key. Then a jingling, and
      the sound of his door opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that an old man is the structure his younger self has built. How
      badly this man has built. Myself, often when tempted to do this or that, I
      have thought&mdash;“Will it make toward a sweet old age?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had talked to me cynically of love, had Sir Robert, only a few hours
      ago. What would he say now if he knew the immensity of the forces he had
      stirred and brought to the surface of my consciousness. I smiled as I
      thought that perhaps I owe much to that old man. I almost wanted to thank
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I stood there by the window, thinking many things. And the April air
      was sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little time I started for my walk, my second walk this day under
      stress of great emotion. But in the course of the few hours intervening I
      had crossed a line. The man who was now about to step lightly down the
      stairs and stroll out through the shabby office of the hotel was a new
      man, one who had never before gone down those stairs or out through that
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lingered a moment by her door. I could hear her light step. And she was
      humming&mdash;oh, so softly! Humming another song by her favorite, Franz.
      It was the dainty, exquisite&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      “Madchen mit dem roten Mündchen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that there was a new brightness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slipped out into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert's door stood open. I stepped across and looked in. I had pushed
      my hat to the back of my head, to let the air cool my forehead. And I
      think I was swinging my stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind the closed door across the hall came, very faintly, that
      floating, silvery voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert's room was in confusion. He had drawn his leather steamer trunk
      to the center of the room, opened it, and placed the tray across an
      arm-chair that stood by the head of the bed. The bed was covered with
      shirts, underwear, collars, books and papers in disorderly heaps. Shoes
      littered the floor. His evening clothes were laid out on the table, other
      suits across a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the edge of the bed, amid the disorder, sat Sir Robert. He was in his
      shirt sleeves. His waistcoat was unbuttoned, his white hair rumpled so
      that it stuck up grotesquely over his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” said I. “Is n't this unexpected?” He looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face never had any color to speak of, but now it was a pasty gray. His
      eyes were sunken, but with a curious sparkle in them. He said nothing,
      just stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” I repeated, “are you leaving?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he merely stared at me. It was unpleasant. I felt my assurance
      fading out, and stood stupidly there, unable to think of anything further
      to say. “He's here!” whispered Sir Robert then.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who&mdash;who&mdash;” My nerves were tightening. The left side of his
      face twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard myself saying&mdash;“But that's impossible. He would n't be here
      yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert dropped his eyes now. I was glad of this. They made me
      extremely uncomfortable. He began packing his shirts in the tray of his
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did he come here?” It was still myself speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good God&mdash;how should I know!” he muttered. “What has that to do with
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know,” he was answering me. “There are trains in the morning. And
      I won't stay here to-night. I won't stay here to-night!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you sure of this?” I asked. Why was it that my mind seemed to be
      refusing utterly to react from this news! Why could n't I realize it! Why
      could n't I think!
    </p>
    <p>
      “He's at the Wagon-lits. I saw him. He is drinking. This is no place for
      you, either. I advise you to move quick.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said I, “I shall see him. He and I got on very well. I shall talk
      with him. It is time some one forced him to listen to reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert, I recall, had a shoe in his hand at this moment. It fell to
      the floor. At the noise, we both started. His face twitched again&mdash;on
      the left side. He looked at me, with eyes like little glass beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?” I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert drew in a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Crocker told me he was going to kill that woman and the man she is living
      with,” he said, slowly and huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” I put in, with a sort of eagerness, “but don't you see&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be exceedingly difficult to convince a jury,” he went on,
      deliberately silencing me, “that she is not at present living with&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?” said I, thinking queer, rapid thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You,” he finished.
    </p>

      <i>April 12th&mdash;very late.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WALKED slowly
      Lack into my own room, trying to think; but my mind was inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next room Heloise was still singing, softly and brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out on the little balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it Sir Robert had said? Oh, yes, that Crocker had come to Peking.
      This was dreadful. It meant trouble. One way or the other, I myself was
      involved in this trouble. A wife is, in a sense, the property of her
      husband&mdash;in a sense. If she dishonors his home by leaving him for
      another, he has some right to be indignant. If his outraged sense of
      possession lashes him into a murderous passion he can not be stopped from
      killing her. In England now&mdash;something about competent witnesses. And
      the difficulty of convincing a jury that she was not living with me....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the confusion of mind that lay over my faculties like a paralysis, one
      curious fact sticks out in my memory. I deliberately shook myself,
      standing there on my balcony. I tried to shake myself awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seemed to be recalling a story that the fat vaudeville manager from
      Cincinnati told on the ship, one night. It had to do with a celebrated
      prize fight in New York some years back. He reveled in memories of fights,
      that vaudeville man. An odd mental habit!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion he mentioned, one fighter was knocked down and very
      nearly, as the phrase runs, “out.” Lying there upon the floor of the ring,
      dazed, all but unconscious, the man actually beat his own head against the
      door in a desperate effort to rouse himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over again that picture rose in my mind. I have never witnessed
      such a spectacle. Primitive brutality has played, needless to say, no part
      in my life. But at this time, caught up and whirled about, as I was, in a
      bewildering conflict of primitive emotions, it was a second-hand
      recollection of the prize ring that came to my aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is not uninteresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chanced to glance down. A tiny, lacy ball lay there at my feet. I picked
      it up. It was Heloise's handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held the absurdly small square of linen and lace in my two hands and
      looked at it. I folded and unfolded it. I pressed it to my lips, again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I to become the helpless victim of these crude emotional uprushes&mdash;like
      any common clerk with his shopgirl? I, who have for so long observed the
      human herd from afar with a sort of casual interest?... I wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the thought of the man Crocker came to me. He was in this city.
      He was over there in the Legation Quarter, behind the walls that I could
      see&mdash;over in the big hotel. He was drinking again. And there was
      murder in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me that this thought&mdash;I am trying to face my strange, new
      self, and set everything down; God know's I need the discipline!&mdash;that
      this thought was followed by a little blaze of heroics. I am somewhat
      confused about this, of course&mdash;one can not analyze one's own
      emotions with any degree of accuracy while they are still active&mdash;but
      I recall going out into the hall and standing there like a sentry. I was
      determined to protect my lady with my life. I saw myself fighting
      gloriously for her; and I saw her, close at hand, witnessing my ever
      valiant act, and exulting in my prowess.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child has such notions. And, I note, a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood for a time at the top of the stairs. Crocker should never mount
      those stairs alive. Behind me, through the transom of number eighteen,
      there occasionally came floating clear little threads of tone. Heloise was
      singing as she moved about her room. She did not know. And she should not
      know&mdash;not yet. Perhaps I could find a way to spare her. At any rate,
      Crocker would never pass those stairs without fighting his way over my
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I tiptoed back and tapped at Sir Robert's door; even tried the knob,
      but it was locked. He had gone, evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't seem to know quite why I sought that old man again. It was an
      impulse. Perhaps I wanted him to see that his warning had had no effect on
      me, none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting on into the early evening now, say between seven and eight.
      I half-saw one of the Chinese waiters come up the stairs with a tray for
      Heloise. I leaned against the wall when he passed. But for some reason it
      did not occur to me to order food for myself. I could not have eaten out
      there in the hall, anyway; and were I to sit in my room, even with the
      door open, there was a possibility that Crocker might rush by before I
      could stop him. So I ate nothing, all the evening. I could n't eat now, if
      food were brought to me. The reactions of what we call love are curiously
      related, it appears, to the various bodily appetites. I am almost ready to
      define love as a general disturbance of all the nerve centers, accompanied
      by strong, positive, emotional excitement and a partial paralysis of the
      reasoning faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little time passed while I stood there at the head of the stairs. A
      fit of impatience, that may have had in it an element of morbid eagerness
      to hasten the event, took possession of me. After all, it was not
      essential that I should stand guard at that particular spot. I walked
      slowly down the stairs and, making a strong effort to appear unconcerned,
      through the office and out the door. He would have to come in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked slowly along the narrow street toward the Italian <i>glacis</i>.
      It would be better, much better, to meet him out here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been a chill in the air this evening. And the wind has risen,
      stirring up clouds of the powdery loess dust that is the curse of this
      wonderful old city.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time I paced that street, breathing at times through my
      handkerchief in order to avoid the choking dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening wore away, my resolution weakened. I began to see myself
      for the absurdity I unquestionably was&mdash;I the thin, nervous man of
      science, pitifully inexperienced in the ways of this sadly violent world,
      yet endeavoring to swell myself up (like the frog in the fable) into a
      creature fit to cope with that world. It <i>is</i> absurd. I am not a
      violent man. I don't understand violence. There is no place for it in my
      philosophy, for my philosophy is based on fact and reason. There is no
      room for violence in an orderly world. Yet, under the pretense of
      civilization which is spread so plausibly over the surface of modern human
      life, I am confronted at every turn by the spirit of violence. And my own
      reason and sense of fact, in which I have so often sought sanctuary, have
      now failed me utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little my walks to and fro carried me farther into the broad
      open park that is called the <i>glacis</i>. That odd, morbid eagerness was
      drawing me steadily nearer and nearer the little foreign city within the
      Legation walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I entered the Quarter. The great masonry walls fairly breathed of
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a sharp angle in this narrow road where it enters the Quarter, so
      constructed that the street can not be raked, from without, by shot and
      shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed under a sentry box on the wall, from which an armed soldier
      peered out at me&mdash;placed there because he might be needed to prevent
      or commit murder. For he and his like are but the trained agents of
      violence, masquerading behind a thin film of patriotism and what men still
      call glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within the walls I walked very rapidly. I was conscious that my whole
      body had tightened nervously, but I was powerless to relax. The blood was
      racing through my arteries and veins. I could feel that old throbbing at
      the back of my head. And my forehead was sweating so that I had to push my
      hat back. I carried my heavy walking stick&mdash;it had seemed that I
      might need it&mdash;and I was swinging it as I walked, gripping it so
      tightly by the middle that it all but hurt my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no stopping me now. I went straight through to Legation Street,
      hurried along it, past the bank and the big German store, and turned off
      south toward the great hotel with its hundreds of bright lights and its
      noisy little swarm of rickshaw men on the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered the wide hall that leads to the office and stood there, while my
      eyes searched about among the moving, chatting groups of people. There was
      a circle of tourists about the old Chinese conjuror who sat on his heels
      in a corner among his cloths and bowls and what not; I walked slowly
      around this circle, seeking the erect figure, the solid shoulders, and the
      drink-flushed face of Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked deliberately through the lounge, studying every solitary figure
      there among the easy chairs and the little tables and the potted
      shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down the long corridor to the bar, and stood squarely on the
      threshold surveying the large room. There was a considerable number of men
      there&mdash;fifty or more, easily. The dress uniforms of half the armies
      of Europe flashed their gilt at me. All the tables were occupied, and
      there was a solid rank at the bar, behind which slab of mahogany the
      sober, silent Chinese waiters worked deftly at catering to the vics of
      these dignified gentlemen from the Christian West, now and then pausing to
      take in the scene with inscrutable, slanting eyes. There was much loud
      talk, some laughter, and, at one of the tables, a little quarreling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, sure enough, was Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the corner across from the door and a little to the left. He was
      alone. A whisky bottle stood before him on the table, and a number of
      glasses. His face was very red. His big, usually vigorous body leaned
      limply against the wall. His head rolled slowly back and forth. There
      could be no doubt that he was very drunk. It seemed to me that he would
      have rolled to the floor had not his body been wedged in between the wall
      and the back of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will admit that I was profoundly relieved. Nothing could be done
      to-night. Crocker could not act, or talk, or even listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now I feel that relief. Though I have observed Crocker closely enough
      to know that when he recovers from this debauch he will be dangerously
      unbalanced, I am glad of even a day's delay. He was in what he himself
      referred to as the “hangover” stage when he knocked down the waiter at
      Yokohama.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may as well admit further&mdash;since this journal must be honest or
      else cease to exist&mdash;that this first sight of the man since Heloise
      entered my life and so vitally changed it was unexpectedly unsettling to
      me. Despite his condition at the moment, I felt again, looking at his
      shoulders and chest and arms and the outlines of his head, the primitive
      force of the man. And the expression of his face, now maudlin with drink,
      oddly recalled my memory of him as I had last seen him at the Yokohama
      station when there were tears on it. I had never before seen a man cry. I
      do not know that the possibility of such extreme emotion in a strong man
      had ever occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He holds ideas regarding men, women and morality that are profoundly
      repellent to me, this crude yet not wholly unattractive man. He is
      permitting his life to be wrecked for these ideas&mdash;which at least
      indicates some sincerity. Heaven knows a man can't “own” a woman, or a
      woman “own” a man. Neither can possibly possess more of the other than
      that other is compelled by the power of love to give. There are no
      “rights” in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet&mdash;and this is the puzzling thing&mdash;when I was with Crocker, I
      liked him. And he liked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savagely as he is mistreating his splendidly vigorous body, desperately as
      he is permitting his mind to become confused and brutalized, he is, even
      now, by no means a besotted man. I am not certain that he could properly
      be termed a drunkard. There is yet stuff in him. There is energy in him,
      that could be used. But in his stubborn purpose of destruction he is
      incidentally destroying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this mystery of sex that it should enter a man's heart in the
      guise of love only to tear that heart to pieces?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale wanderings, these! And sad. For they tell me that in all the
      so-called practical affairs of life I am a weak person of confused
      mentality. There is bitterness in the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rather like that man. I think I feel a deep pity for him. And I am his
      mortal enemy. I can not understand it. But it is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I will give you up, you Journal that have so long been my
      companion in the rich solitude of my working life. For this life of mine
      is a working life no longer. It has turned off into the dark byways of
      passion. My purpose, hitherto compelling, falters now. My once clear mind
      is clouded and confused. I do not know when I shall work again. I do not
      know what I shall do. I only know that all is dark and still in the room
      next to this dingy room of mine, and that a sad, beautiful woman sleeps
      softly there. I only know that I love her beyond my strength, and yet that
      I seem unable to hate the man who would hate me if he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only a little later&mdash;in the very early morning. I have
      reconsidered. I shall not yield to this weakness. After all, it may steady
      me to continue my old-time habit of writing everything down. Besides, it
      is clear that I shall have no sleep this night. It will be better to keep
      occupied at something.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my weakness for introspection, I think, that brought me to that
      state of bewilderment. I seem to get along better when I confine my
      narrative closely to the facts. I must resolve again, as I have resolved
      before, simply to tell what took place. Just tell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away from the bar-room door. A number of men from one of the
      legations approached along the corridor. They were talking and laughing
      rather freely, and were all tall men, so that I neither heard nor saw the
      man behind them until after I had stepped aside and across the corridor to
      let them pass in to the bar. And the man behind followed them in without
      seeing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sir Robert. He was in evening dress, of course, true to his British
      breeding. His monocle dangled against his shirt front. He was bowed a
      little. His hands shook perceptibly as he walked. And I observed that same
      new nervous twitching on the left side, of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped a little way into the room and looked about, as I had done. I
      waited. I did not seem to care whether he saw me or not, but felt no
      desire to invite conversation with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes finally rested on the drunken man in the corner. His left eyelid
      drooped and drooped, as it always does when he is thinking intently. It
      seemed to me that he stood there for a long time, and that there was
      irresolution on his face. Myself, I could not take my eyes off him; it
      fascinated me to watch his drooping eyelid and the twitching corner of his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he slowly turned and came out. He did not so much as know
      that I was there. He was studying the carpeted floor&mdash;thinking,
      thinking. I followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly out through the lounge to the street door, bowing coldly
      to certain of the individuals he passed. He went out, and down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ragged rickshaw coolies pressed about him. He brushed them aside with
      his hand. For a moment he stood there, on the stone sidewalk. Once he
      turned, as if to reenter the hotel; but wavered, and stood still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought he saw me, waiting in the doorway, but believe now that he did
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he stepped up into a rickshaw, and waved his hand. His coolie
      picked up the shafts and set off on a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried down the steps, leaped into the next rickshaw, and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went as directly as the streets permitted to our little <i>Hôtel de
      Chine.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was coming back!
    </p>
    <p>
      I dismissed my rickshaw at the corner of the street and walked to the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to be seen in office or lounge, so I went on up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I mounted, I heard voices. I stopped short when my eyes cleared the top
      step, and looked down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise's door was a little ajar. I could tell this by the rectangular
      shaft of light thrown from her room across the dim passage. Sir Robert had
      unlocked his own door, just across from it, and was standing with his hand
      on the knob, crouching a little, evidently listening to the conversation
      in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the voices&mdash;that of a man&mdash;grew a little louder; but I
      was too far off, there on the stairs, to catch what he was saying. Then
      rather abruptly, the door swung open and the man backed out. He was the
      manager of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant Sir Robert, with agility surprising in one of his age,
      darted into his own room and swiftly, but softly, swung the door nearly to
      behind him. The manager was too intent on his own words and thoughts to
      know of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not think what to do. The one thing I was sure of was that I did
      not want to speak to the manager, coming, as he was, directly from her
      room. So I ran down the stairs, and was in the lounge looking at a
      magazine when he appeared on the ground floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited a few moments longer, then went up again. I simply had to know
      what Sir Robert was about. And again I stopped when my head rose just
      above the top step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, there he was&mdash;that old man!&mdash;crouching by her door
      and tapping softly at it with his shaking fingers. I felt a slow, cold
      sort of dread creep across my mind and my nerves. I did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped and tapped&mdash;oh, so softly! He stooped to the keyhole and
      whispered. I could not hear him, but I could see it all in pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave this up; and stood thinking. He slipped into his own room and
      switched on the light, but did not close the door. In a very short time he
      reappeared with a white paper in his hand&mdash;an envelope, doubtless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the second time I had to watch this monstrous old man get down on
      his shaking knees and with a pencil thrust his evil communication in under
      her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, he got to his feet (I could hear his heavy breathing), lingered
      only a moment, then returned to his room, leaving his door ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came on up the stairs then, walking as heavily as possible, and let
      myself into my own room here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept silent for quite a time until I heard Sir Robert's door shut. Then
      I tapped on Heloise's door. Again and again I tapped there, but she would
      not reply. She is avoiding me, and that is disturbing. Her light went out
      soon after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      On looking back, I see that I have spoken of her as sleeping. Since then I
      have thought, on two occasions, that I have heard her tiptoeing about her
      room; but for the most part it has been unusually still there. I have
      wondered if she is out on her balcony; but I dare not look. I shrink from
      it. For she is avoiding me. She would not answer my tapping on her door&mdash;the
      light, nervous tapping that she knows so well. And one thought stands out
      in all the dreadful, turbulent confusion of this hour. It is that I must
      not try to see her if she does not wish to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just two o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not sleep. I shall not even undress. This is not wise of me, I
      suppose. But it is the way I feel. And I am a creature of feeling now. It
      would help to pass these dreadful hours if I could go on writing&mdash;or
      if I could read. But she will know it if I do not put out my light.
      Perhaps she would worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I shall sit here in the dark. Or walk to the window and look out at the
      sleeping city&mdash;at this rich old capital of a peaceful people, who
      smile languidly at the turbulent West from which I spring (like Crocker
      and his sorry kind)&mdash;who turn from the miseries of actual life to the
      philosophy of their ancient seers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, come to think of it, I am wrong here. Even gentle, contemplative
      old China has been drawn from her slumber of the ages into the whirlpool
      of modern life. I was thinking of the past. I had forgotten. They are
      carving out a republic here now. Their hands are stained with blood. And
      the sometimes violent bankers of the Western world sit coldly over them
      while they struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no peace. There is no clear thought. There is only life. Only
      life.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL the rest of
      that night of the 12th-13th I sat in my dark room, or softly walked the
      floor, or gazed out at the sleeping city fit un my one window. And all
      night I was conscious of unusual and increasingly violent nervous
      reactions. Turning the pages back, I note that I attempted the other day
      to write a definition of love. This was absurd. I do not know what love
      is. Nobody knows. It is a capricious and wild thing. It flashes like the
      lightning, and rushes like the wind. It grows by feeding on itself. It
      exalts. It devastates. It contains within itself all the latent
      possibilities of nobility and service, of lust and jealousy, of
      tenderness, of sacrifice, of murder. It is a blind, insistent force; yet
      it shines before the mind's eye like dewdrops on the gossamer wings of
      fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning finally came, I stood there at my window and watched the sun
      climb slowly over the Legation walls. It was a flat red sun, hung behind a
      film of dusty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered how long it would be before I should tap on Heloise's door. Not
      long. I feared. All night I had been waiting; all night I had been
      withholding my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard her get up, and stir about her room. I wondered if she had slept.
      Perhaps, for she still did not know what I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long, long time I waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, at seven o'clock. I tiptoed across the creaking floor. I stood
      there by the door. I raised my hand, then dropped it. My throat became
      suddenly dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been stirring there, on the other side of the door. Now, at the
      sound, she was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tapped again. And again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I whispered her name. I spoke it louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would not do. Sir Robert had tapped at her door. He too had
      whispered. She had not answered him. She would not now answer me. I turned
      away&mdash;hurt, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how long I stood there, motionless, a little way from the
      door. I could not think clearly. And all the time it seemed to me that I
      must force myself to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time I deliberately went downstairs and ordered a light breakfast.
      But when it came I could not eat it. I could only nibble at a crust of
      toast and sip a little of the <i>café au lait</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out into the air and walked about. It was absolutely necessary that
      I should steady myself. The day was big with evil possibilities. Crocker,
      if I could judge from my one previous experience with him, might be up and
      about by mid-afternoon. I must control myself. I must be calm. Crocker had
      a set purpose and a strong body. I, presumably, though weak in body, had a
      mind. I was the only obstacle between Crocker and his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just a quarter past nine when I turned back into the street that
      led to the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>. The shops, with their highly colored
      displays and their quaint smells, were all buzzing with the rush of the
      morning trade. Coolies, merchants, purchasers and idlers of all ages
      jostled to and fro. Underfoot the children swarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was picking my way through this busy little thoroughfare, when, looking
      up, I saw Heloise step out of the hotel. She wore a veil that hid her
      face, from me. And then she was a hundred feet or so away. She turned in
      my direction. The street crowd closed in between us, and for a moment I
      lost sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember plunging crazily forward to meet her. Then I saw her again, and
      my heart stood still. For Sir Robert had followed her out of the hotel and
      caught up with her. She had stopped, and was listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her arm from his touch. But she made no effort to leave him.
      She was standing irresolute, I thought, listening to him. I plunged toward
      them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly I stopped. For they were walking together now&mdash;right
      toward me. He was bending down over her. I could see that he was talking
      to her, very earnestly. And she was listening!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out with his stick, as I watched, and brushed a group of
      coolies aside. He was protecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just stood there. I could not think out what I ought to do. I had meant
      to rescue her from him. But I could not do this against her wish. A moment
      more and they would be upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I hesitated. Finally, really without any plan of action, I stepped
      up and into a Chinese shop and watched them as they walked slowly by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking&mdash;still talking&mdash;in a low, insistent voice. I
      could not hear what he was saying. And I could not quite make out her
      expression behind her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were well past, I stepped out. I followed. For I had come to
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the <i>glacis</i>, they turned to the right, walking, oh, so slowly.
      And I, a miserable thing with nothing but ungovernable turbulence in my
      heart, dodged in and out among the street traffic, and shadowed them. I
      shadowed the woman I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went&mdash;without thought or aim, apparently&mdash;around outside
      the wall of the Imperial City and toward the Chien Gate. At the western
      end of Legation Street they paused, and for a few minutes stood on the
      corner. He was talking, talking, talking. I saw him making eager, nervous
      gestures with his monocle between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly, they moved on toward the old stone ramp that leads up to the
      top of the Tartar Wall, just outside the compound of the American
      Legation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not follow them here, for I should certainly be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise hesitated once, and it seemed to me that she meant to draw back.
      But after a moment she went on, and together they slowly mounted the
      incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away. I tried to tell myself that there was no significance in
      this walk of theirs. Whatever it was he wished to say&mdash;up there on
      the broad summit of the Wall where they could walk and talk in quiet,
      removed from the turmoil of the city&mdash;certainly she had a right to
      listen if she chose. He had been annoying her persistently. She was not
      the sort to run away from anything. She was unafraid. Perhaps by facing
      him and hearing him out she would dispose of him once and for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not succeed in imposing this attitude of mind on myself. And I
      am going to tell what followed. It marks the lowest point to which this
      strange new self of mine has sunk&mdash;as yet. It must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked like mad the whole length of Legation Street&mdash;a mile.
      Perhaps I ran. I don't know. I rushed by the Wagon-lits Hotel with no more
      than a glance. I did not seem to care that Crocker was in there and might
      soon emerge. I did not seem to care about anything. I was all empty&mdash;life
      was laughing at me for all the years I had taken it so seriously and so
      hard. Yet, empty and purposeless as I felt, the forces that keep at me so,
      these days, were overwhelming me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out through the German Gate saying&mdash;aloud&mdash;“What do I
      know about this woman? What is she to me? Who is she, that I should permit
      her to devastate my life!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Some German soldiers heard me, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I stood, a thin little man, doubtless flushed and wild of eye,
      laying bare my poor tom heart to the world; and the soldiers were laughing
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hurried away. An empty rickshaw was passing. I hailed it and leaped in.
      I rode straight to my little hotel. I ran up the stairs. I let myself into
      my room, and slammed the door shut behind me. I tore open the drawer of
      the bureau where I had carefully put away the ten cylinders on which
      Heloise and I had painstakingly recorded the close-interval scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got them out, the ten boxes that I had labeled so carefully. I threw
      them on the bed in a heap. I stood over them. As nearly as I can recall it
      now, I laughed at them. For they were hers. She had made them. She had
      made them for me; and I had held her within my arms. The picture of her
      there on my balcony, came to me with poignant vividness. And another
      picture&mdash;Heloise, in her chair with her sewing in her lap, singing
      that difficult scale successfully for the first time, and trilling softly
      and triumphantly on the last note, while her eyes sought mine. It was all
      utterly bewildering. Suddenly, from laughing, I had to tight back the sobs
      that came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that I tore open the boxes, one by one, and threw the
      cylinders to the floor and stamped on them. They were merely a waxy
      composition, not hard to destroy. I did not stop until my floor was strewn
      with the pieces. And now no longer in there, anywhere in the world, a
      finely perfect close-interval scale as a standard basis of comparison for
      the tone-intervals of so-called primitive music. Von Stumbostel will never
      know of my triumph now. Nor Boag, nor Ramel, nor Fourmont, nor de Musseau,
      nor Sir Frederick Rhodes. That beastly little von Westfall, of Bonn, can
      snarl to his heart's content, unrefuted. And the British Museum will never
      see this great result that might well have crowned my work and my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      All about the room were scattered the bits of broken cylinders. I stood
      among them, trying to think ahead. But I could n't think ahead. All I
      seemed to know was that I could stay no longer in this shabby little
      hostelry where my life had soared so high and sunk so low.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cleared a space in the middle of the room with my foot, kicking the
      pieces of my once precious cylinders aside as if they were pebbles. I drew
      out my steamer trunk, and opened it; got my clothes from the wardrobe and
      threw them in heaps on the bed; jerked out bureau drawers and set them on
      chairs and on the floor where I could reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still working furiously at my packing when she came in, alone. I
      heard her light, quick step in the hall, I heard her unlock her door, and
      enter her room. Then she locked it again, on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there, coatless and collarless. I wanted to tap once more at her
      door. I hesitated over this thought. I resisted it. I fought with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I put on my collar and coat, picked up my hat, and rushed out. I
      could finish the packing later. Certainly, I could n't finish it now, with
      every nerve tip quiveringly conscious of her nearness, there behind the
      thin partition and the shrunken door.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I should find it too hard to come back later, I decided then, I would
      send a Chinese valet from the other hotel to finish the job for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the qualities that go to make up the unrest that we call love, it
      appears that self-absorption plays no small part. Perhaps this
      selfishness, lying at the root of desire, is the element of positive force
      in love. I wonder! Certainly, without it, love would be much more nearly a
      negative thing than it actually is.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very primitive, very confused, very petty, this outbreak of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, life is that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have destroyed my scales!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after eleven&mdash;in the morning&mdash;when I went away from the
      <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was angry, bitter. Nothing in the world seemed important except my own
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough what I was going to do. There were two or three other
      shabby little hotels outside the Quarter. But I was going straight to the
      Wagon-lits. It was twelve o'clock now. I decided to have my tiffin there.
      Then perhaps I would send a man around to finish my packing and fetch my
      luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked deliberately into the great, gay hotel, I was in spirit not
      unlike a man who has awakened from a turbulent dream. For here were the
      familiar folk of the West. On the preceding evening, when I had first
      entered this building, the same groups of tourists, business and military
      men, and diplomats, with their ladies, had been here; but then I had seen
      them with different eyes. Now they looked natural, as we say. And their
      voices fell on my ears with a pleasant reminder of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a chair in the lounge, and sat hack to watch the bright,
      chattering, shifting crowd. I glanced about for Crocker, of course, but
      saw no sign of him. A little later, just before tiffin, I looked up his
      box, at the desk. I wanted to ask about him, but feared that the clerk
      would think I wished to see him. God knows I did n't wish that! It was at
      this time, I think, that I began to realize the shadowy nature of the
      curious revulsion of feeling that I had been passing through, on this day.
      I did not feel so great relief as I had just been telling myself I was
      feeling. Those vivid mental pictures of Heloise, as I had seen her so
      often in her room or mine, kept flashing before me.... No, I didn't want
      to see Crocker. I did want to know where he was, and what he was doing.
      His box told me nothing. There were no letters in it; and his key was not
      there. But I had no doubt he was still in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate my tiffin alone in the big dining-room, seated where I could watch
      the door. I fortified myself with the latest papers, and tried to believe
      that it would be pleasant to pass a leisurely hour or two there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was restless. I did n't seem to want to read, now that I had my
      comfortable chair, and unusually good food. When the coffee came, I drank
      it at a gulp, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped over to the desk to pay for my tiffin. I reached into my pocket
      for my purse. My fingers touched something filmy&mdash;Heloise's
      handkerchief! I could not resist bringing it out, there with the Belgian
      clerk looking coldly at me, and staring at it&mdash;that rumpled little
      ball o f linen and lace. This for a moment: then I paid my bill and walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went right out to the street. I had to stare again at the little
      handkerchief. I had to press it to my lips. The rickshaw coolies could see
      me; but I cared nothing for them, though the tears were crowding into my
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not come to my senses all at once. I must have walked about until
      three o'clock or thereabouts. At least, it was twenty minutes past three
      when I found myself again in the street that leads from the Italian <i>glacis</i>
      to our little <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>. I was humble now, and very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I had gone to pieces this day. I had failed the woman I love. In
      bitter, jealous anger I had failed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had discovered in myself the meanest of qualities&mdash;suspicion. And
      utter selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen times in those hours of my revulsion Crocker might have come to
      kill her&mdash;and I not at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until I entered the hotel and observed the sleepy quiet of the
      office and lounge that I was reassured. I could not bring myself to go
      upstairs, for she had made it so heartbreakingly plain that she would not
      see me. But surely all was well, as yet. Had there been trouble, there
      would be signs of it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if she had gone out for her customary afternoon walk. This
      thought bothered me. For then she would be coming back. I could not escape
      seeing her. Now, I wanted to see her, and I did not want to see her. I
      seemed to have reached a point, at last, where I knew that I would not go
      to pieces again. But this was only while I was reasonably sure that I
      could avoid her. If I were to meet her face to face, to look again into
      her great blue eyes with the long, long lashes, perhaps to clasp her hand,
      I knew that I could not be sure of anything. Once that magic were to surge
      again in my heart, my reason would fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the facts of that strange revulsion which pointed out to me for
      the first time a pitiful flaw in my character. I failed Heloise when her
      need of me was most desperate. And nothing but luck (as we term it) saved
      her from the worst possible consequences of my weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in my life that I had been put to a rough, hard
      test. And&mdash;the flaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      I deduce from this fact the conclusion that the sheltered life, with its
      corollary of so-called right living, permits no true demonstration of
      character. That fine quality is found in the open, where men (and women)
      breast the rough tide of life, and blunder, and struggle, and suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paced our little street, from the hotel entrance to the <i>glacis</i>,
      until twenty minutes of six. Heloise did not appear; so doubtless she was
      safe in her room. Crocker did not appear; so doubtless he was still drunk,
      over at the Wagon-lits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered a good deal about Sir Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he entered our street in a rickshaw. I stood squarely in the
      doorway of the hotel as he stepped down and paid off his coolie. He looked
      about him with quick, furtive glances as he crossed the walk. His eyes
      were tired, but heady and bright. There were spots of color on his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to pass so near to me that he could have touched me. I was staring
      right at him, expectantly. I wanted to meet his eye, to make him meet
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he cut me. It was the direct cut, such as only an Englishman can
      administer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on into the building. I hesitated but a second, then turned
      abruptly and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the desk, getting his mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to a stop behind him, and fingered a magazine that was on a table
      there. It was my intention to make him speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager came forward from an inner office, brushing his clerk aside.
      He said something&mdash;several sentences&mdash;in a low voice and with a
      hesitating, apologetic manner; then he handed Sir Robert a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man adjusted his monocle, lifted the paper, and read it. Then,
      slowly, he crumpled it in his unsteady fingers and dropped it on the
      counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You contemptible scoundrel!” he said, with one sharp glance at the
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is that I do not want to turn out the lady&mdash;to the street,”
      the manager struggled to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Robert walked away&mdash;into the lounge, where he beckoned a
      waiter and deliberately ordered his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there for a few moments, I think, quite motionless. Was it
      possible that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Heloise's bill for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped up to the desk, and asked for the manager. He came out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I heard you speak of turning out a lady,” I said, looking straight at
      him. “What did you mean by that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, then reached into his pocket and produced that identical
      crumpled ball of paper that Sir Robert had let fall on the counter. He
      spread it out, and smoothed down the wrinkles. “Perhaps,” he murmured, “I
      have make the mistake. It is too bad to think that the lady she can not&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I snatched up the paper. It was Heloise's bill, for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid him right then and there&mdash;in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He muttered a jumble of apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cut him short. “You <i>have</i> made a mistake,” I said. “Now have the
      kindness to keep your head shut, will you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed himself back into his little den. I turned and found Sir Robert
      looking straight at me, from his chair. I must admit that his eyes never
      wavered. And there, for a long, tense moment we stared at each other like
      the enemies we were. Then I walked out to the doorway to resume my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a fox he was! Even in his desperate, terror-stricken pursuit of
      Heloise, he had deftly avoided entangling himself before an outsider. And
      he had extricated himself, as if by instinct, from the slightest financial
      risk in the matter. I knew then that this old man would give nothing save
      as a <i>quid pro quo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more I quite forgot him. I stood there in the little street,
      looking at the shopkeepers in their doorways sipping their bowls of tea
      after the rush and turmoil of the day. But I don't think I saw anything
      clearly; I remember some such scene, and know that I must have observed it
      at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the thought of Heloise, penniless in this sorry, shabby place, was
      almost more than I could endure. Though I had wondered, and even worried,
      about her finances, somehow I had not thought of her condition as utterly
      desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know what she would say&mdash;or think; for she would say little&mdash;if
      she knew that I had paid the account for her. Even yet, I have not told
      her. I have got to tell her, but I see that it is going to be difficult, I
      must think out some way of broaching the subject. Perhaps I shouldn't have
      done it. Or perhaps a more tactful man would have found some less crude
      way of managing it. I can't say as to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, I suddenly remembered that odd little scene of the
      preceding evening that I had witnessed from the stairway&mdash;the manager
      in her room talking to her, and Sir Robert outside, at his own door,
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known of this trouble. His knowledge of it had held him here to
      annoy her with skilfully aimed persistence. She had been unwilling to come
      to me. She had not known what to do. She had been helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the thoughts that raced through my mind as I stood there in the
      doorway! And the pictures that my heated fancy contrived! I wanted to rush
      up those stairs and make her speak to me. It was all I could do to fight
      this impulse. I knew that I was going to do this, sooner or later; but I
      knew too that I could hold out a little longer. For I must not thrust
      myself, an ungoverned, passion-shaken man, into her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sir Robert had gone up, I am sure I would have followed him. But he did
      not. He sipped his tea for a long time, and nibbled his toast. I could
      look in through the doorway and see him. Then he tried to read. Then he
      wandered about the lounge, like a tortured ghost of passions that had died
      with his prime. Once he came to the hall and stood irresolute at the foot
      of the stairs, twisting his monocle in his shaking fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he saw me standing there like a sentry. And he walked hurriedly
      back into the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time dragged on. When I looked again at my watch it was five
      minutes of eight. It was time for Sir Robert's dinner. Few things in life.
      I knew, were more Important to him. Perhaps he would go over to the
      Wagon-lits for it. Anyway, unless he had some definite knowledge of
      Crocker's whereabouts, he would not wait about here much longer, for he
      was a coward; his assurance had been undermined by the consciousness of
      his own guilty intentions. That much I had seen twenty-four hours and more
      earlier, when he warned me about Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not go to the Wagon-lits. He went, instead, into the dingy
      dining-room of our own hotel. And I kept my watch, out there at the street
      door. A little later it occurred to me that I had seen no tray going up
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped in and ordered the manager to send up a waiter to number
      eighteen. There seemed to be no use in holding back now. So far as that
      manager was concerned, I had crossed the line&mdash;both for myself and
      Heloise. And he, at least, would say nothing. His poor mind was already
      full of such unpleasant secrets as he imagined mine to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter went up, and in a moment returned. The manager stepped out to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The lady she does not answer to the waiter's knock,” said he, all concern
      and deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only bite my lip, and try to think, and then turn away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon Sir Robert came out from the dining-room, and made straight
      for the stairs. He was walking slowly and rather uncertainly. It seemed to
      me that he was a good deal bent. When he reached the hall, I observed that
      the spots of color had left his cheeks. His face, indeed, was pasty white.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped inside and tried to make him face me. But he cut me again,
      magnificently. He reached for the railing, and slowly mounted the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately I followed. So we went up to the second floor&mdash;he
      fumbling along just ahead of me, I holding back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood behind him while he unlocked his door. But weak as he was
      physically, he never once let down in his attitude of ignoring my
      existence. I am not so certain that he is a coward. I <i>am</i> certain
      only that the human creature is extremely complex, extremely difficult to
      classify and formulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, and made an effort to shut the door in my face. But I caught
      it on my elbow, and followed him in, closing it behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank into a chair, and looked up at me. Now, at last he had to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well&mdash;” he asked, “what is it? Why do you come in here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept my voice well in hand. Heloise must not hear this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To ask you several questions,” I replied. “Where is Crocker?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the Wagon-lits&mdash;still drunk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I saw him, only a few hours hack. Went to his room, in fact.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking, I have realized since, with some physical effort; but his
      mind was steady enough. He seemed to be simply making the best of it,
      since he had been unable to keep me out by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is not likely to be up and about before the morning?” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is certain not to. But they stopped selling him liquor this afternoon.
      I learned that from the manager. So he will be nervous to-morrow. And
      probably dangerous. Undoubtedly dangerous.” His eyes flitted about the
      room, and then I saw that his baggage, all packed excepting one bag, was
      still there. “So I will leave him to you. I take the Tientsin train early
      to-morrow. And alone, I regret to add.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This stung, but I held myself in control.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had hopes that the lady would leave with me,” he added. “I would have
      done very well by her. Extravagantly well. For she is, I may say, a person
      of unusual charm. But now, of course, that you are openly paying her
      bills, I leave the field to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept my hands close at my sides, and stood straight there before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I gave you some advice the other day, my boy,” he continued. “Bear it in
      mind. The woman is helpless. I confess I don't see what on earth she can
      do. For she is a highly impractical little thing She has very little idea
      of the value of money. I offered more than I had any business to&mdash;offered
      to send her back to Europe and help her along with her studies. It seemed
      the only way to reach her, don't you know&mdash;the line of her ambition,
      and therefore her weakest point. I used all the familiar arguments. And
      God knows most of them are true enough&mdash;that private morality is of
      no consequence in an operatic career, that a woman need conform to
      suburban standards only if she is seeking a suburban success. I pointed
      out notorious episodes in the lives of great women performers whom we all
      admire, women of unquestioned position. But do you know, my boy, not one
      of these arguments appeared to reach her at all. She is to me, I must say,
      an extraordinary contradiction. Here she is, deserted and destitute on the
      China Coast, where a woman can not travel alone for a day without
      advertising herself as a marketable commodity; and yet, so far as I can
      see, she is, in a sense, a good woman. Really, it was n't until I pointed
      out the wreckage she was making of your life, and the service she could do
      you by accepting my money and getting away from you, that she would so
      much as listen to me&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at me, and his voice trailed off into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did nothing, except to say, in a voice that I knew to be my own
      because he was no longer speaking and there was certainly no other person
      in the room&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you talked of me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are frank, Sir Robert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand. “Why not?” Then he went on. “The most puzzling point in
      her puzzling story is that part relating to the other man&mdash;the one
      that brought her out here. She makes no effort to justify her actions, as
      we expect a woman to do when she has gone wrong in the eyes of men.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh&mdash;so you asked her about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” He indulged in a wry, fleeting smile. “I brought up everything&mdash;used
      all my logic, Eckhart. I was, like you, a fool to want her at all with
      that crazy husband so close on her heels; but I did want her, and I worked
      hard for a few hours.” He sighed. “Do you know, all she has to say of the
      man with whom she traveled from New York clear to Peking, is&mdash;' That
      was a dreadful mistake. I was n't the sort of woman he thought me.' And
      when I spoke sympathetically of his cruelty in deserting her, she quietly
      informed me that he did nothing of the kind.... What do you say to that,
      my boy? <i>She left him!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite warmed up to his story now. He even chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you say to that, young man? This exceedingly attractive young
      person, very nearly penniless, quite unhampered by practical experience,
      turns the man off, refuses his money, and starts out to face life&mdash;in
      Peking&mdash;alone and without so much as a plan of action! It is pitiful,
      of course. It is tragic. But it does stir the fancy. Now, doesn't it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know,” I said slowly, “why I don't beat you to death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His face, I thought, grew even whiter. But his eyes met mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know why,” he replied deliberately. “Because a gentleman does not
      commonly enter the room of another gentleman for any such unmannerly
      purpose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed a sort of assent to this. He really had me there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, Eckhart,” he added, “while you have a perfect right to call me a
      fool, you certainly can't say that, as life runs, my attitude has been
      unnatural. The woman deliberately broke with life. As a result of her own
      acts, she is now outside the pale of decent society.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Outside&mdash;where we men are,” said I, very sad and bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sniffed, rather contemptuously. He thought my observation too obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I added, as I turned toward the door&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “And at that, after your own tribute to the essential fineness of her
      character, your notion of 'decent society' sounds highly technical to me,
      Sir Robert. Good-by to you. You will forgive me for saying that I shall be
      very glad when you are gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply. But as I laid my hand on the knob of the door, I caught
      a low exclamation behind me that seemed to have both pain and surprise in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked back. He had sunk down in his chair. One side of his face, the
      left side, had twitched upward so that there was a distinct slant to his
      mouth and an observably deep, curving line extending from the left lower
      corner of his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you ill?” I asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly shook his head. “Something snapped, I thought,” he replied,
      rather huskily. “But I am all here, evidently.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall be glad to call a doctor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you&mdash;it is quite unnecessary. If you will be so good as to
      have the manager send me a competent body servant, it will be sufficient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you may need medical attention.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it will not be difficult to reach McKenzie, over at the Legation. I
      won't trouble you further&mdash;beyond that matter of the servant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed and went out, closing his door behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there for a moment in the hall. It seemed a very long time since I
      had seen Heloise or heard from her. And now, thanks to that old man, I had
      a new set of mental pictures to touch my spirit, and stir me, and rouse
      feelings so subtle, so haunting, so poignant, that I could hardly bear
      them. Yet, I thought, these are my new mental companions, these thoughts
      and feelings and partly distinct, partly elusive, mind pictures, and it is
      with them I have got to live for the rest of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened. She was in there, surely, behind that closed door. The transom
      was closed, too. I could hear no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided then to make her speak to me. And it seemed to me that now I
      could give without asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hopes for myself were running as high as that&mdash;to give without
      asking, and to reassure her poor tortured spirit by so appearing and
      acting that she would know, through her fine intuition, that I had risen
      to this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran downstairs and told the manager of Sir Robert's request. I also
      suggested that in my judgment medical care was indicated. He looked
      puzzled, and a thought worried, that little French manager; as if unable
      to determine whether I had killed Sir Robert or had suddenly become his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I came back upstairs and entered my own room. I turned on the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped softly to the shrunken door, and listened. For a moment I
      thought I heard nothing; then my heart gave a leap, for her bed began
      creaking as if she were tossing restlessly upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her room. However desperate, however tortured of spirit, she
      was there!
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a sound&mdash;a sort of moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tapped on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door an inch. Her room was dark. Without looking in, I placed
      my mouth close to the opening, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh&mdash;Heloise!”
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. I had thought to conceal my own emotions. I had thought to
      speak gently, kindly&mdash;in a way that would make her feel me there as a
      steady, helpful friend. But my voice suddenly choked. And all I could say
      was, “Oh&mdash;Heloise!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited there. I felt that I must not intrude. I could not think just
      what would be best to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she tossed again, restlessly. And she moaned, with a sort of muffled
      shudder in her voice, as if she had set her teeth and was fighting with
      all her waning strength to keep from making a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could n't stand it. I opened the door. The light from my room fell
      across her bed and showed her there, her lovely arms outside the coverlet,
      her dark hair, in a thick, long braid, lying on the pillow and across her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not' speak. I entered (thinking vividly of that first time
      that I had ventured unasked into this dingy little room that was the only
      place in the world she could call, even momentarily, her own ). I went
      straight to the bed. I took one unresisting hand in mine, and gazed down
      at her during the moment that my eyes were accustoming themselves to this
      dimmer light.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rolled her head weakly around on the pillow, and looked up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that she was very white. Her eyes were shining at me out of
      great, dark circles. There were marks of pain, of physical suffering, on
      her dear face, such as I had never before seen there. Hitherto she had
      merely been sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sank down, sitting on the edge of the bed. I could not say anything. I
      stroked her wrists. I gently smoothed her forehead and temples and cheeks.
      Her skin was cool, almost cold, to the touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great eyes sought mine. Weak and ill as she was, I knew that she was
      looking into my soul, and studying it, perhaps wondering about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, now, there would be no more evasion between us. I felt that.
      Whatever she might say to me, when she should feel able to talk, would
      come directly from the most sacred depths of her consciousness. We had
      never been so close. Even at that sad moment, the thought thrilled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to turn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that her bureau, over which she and I had once expended, ages
      ago, an absurd amount of energy, had been moved, and stood squarely across
      the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, why had she done that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still stroking her forehead and temples, trying to control the fever
      that was in my veins, trying to think clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked again at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made an effort to smile at me. There was infinite sadness in that
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned toward me, on her side, hiding her face from me,
      pillowing it on my hands, which she held close, if weakly, with her own
      cold hands. And again that low, pitiful sound escaped her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wanted to die,” she breathed. “I wanted to die! Why did n't you let me
      die!”
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned her face to mine, and bent low over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What have you done?” I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, almost convulsively, and tried to hide her face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, have you done?” I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked more closely at the bureau, dreading what I might see upon it.
      But there were only the famihar little toilet accessories that I had seen
      there before. My eyes searched about among them, while I sat there on the
      bed, while she continued to press my hands, with her own cold ones,
      against her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I looked down. On the floor, almost at my feet, was a glass with a
      little water in it. Near by was a small brown medicine bottle, with beaded
      edges. The cork was out. A little cotton lay by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I picked up the bottle, and turned it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was labeled:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poison.” And beneath this, “Morphia,
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise!” I cried. I made her look at me. “Heloise, child! You don't mean&mdash;you
      have n't&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head moved between my hands; and I knew she was trying to nod an
      affirmation. Then she struggled again to turn her face from me, but so
      weakly that I held it there without much difficulty. I fear I was
      employing more strength than I realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How much did you take?” I said. “Tell me&mdash;quickly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know,” she whispered. “The bottle was full. I took them all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible,” I argued, foolishly. “Two grains would have killed
      you. One grain, even.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I took them all,” she repeated. “I wanted so to die. I thought for a
      while that I was dying. Then I became dreadfully ill. I have been so ill,
      Anthony!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a note of relief had come into her voice&mdash;as if it meant
      something to her, after all, to have me there with her, and to be able to
      talk with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that. But it was not the time to think of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up. But she clung to one of my hands, and I had to bend a little.
      I was trying to think&mdash;What do they give for morphine poisoning? What
      are the antidotes?... Stimulants, surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had some strychnine in my little medicine-chest. I gently withdrew my
      hand, and went into my room to look for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt uncertain about this treatment, for I am no physician. But it might
      be that there was no time to lose. She was weak, and extremely nervous.
      The coldness of her hands led me to believe that at some moment after she
      took the drug her heart action must have all but stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, in my disordered room&mdash;for my steamer trunk was open,
      my clothes still lay in rumpled heaps on the bed, the cluttered bureau
      drawers stood about on chairs and on the table&mdash;I made up my mind to
      give her the strychnine. I did not realize then that there were physicians
      to be had. I felt only our remoteness from the conveniences of civilized
      life, here in this little hotel in the Tartar City.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would doubtless have been better to administer the stimulant by the
      hypodermic syringe. But I had none. So I refilled her glass with water,
      gave her two of my strychnine pills, and raised her head while she sipped
      the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not recall now whether or not she resisted this treatment. I think
      she did, a little. But she was so completely exhausted, in body and
      spirit, by all she had gone through, that she really could do nothing but
      follow my instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I rang for a boy&mdash;from my own room. It was getting pretty late
      in the evening; but I made him fetch me a large pot of black coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lifted her, and slipped the two pillows behind her that I had brought in
      from my own bed, and made her as nearly comfortable as I could. When the
      coffee came I poured out three cups of it, one after another, and stood
      over her while she drank them. She protested, every moment, but I paid no
      attention to her words, just held the cup to her lips until it was empty
      and then refilled it twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, I put the tray in my own room, and did what little I could to
      make her room more attractive to the eye. I moved the bureau from the hall
      door to its place against the side wall, the place it had occupied ever
      since she and I had moved it for the last time away from the door that
      connected our rooms. I even straightened out the various articles on the
      bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time I felt her great, weary eyes following me about, the
      room. She was distinctly relieved, I thought, at the sharp way in which I
      had taken command of her life. Poor child, she had tried hard enough to
      end that life. She had passed through the valley, of the shadow. And now,
      cheated yet relieved, she leaned on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that hour my mind has dwelt on the horrors she must have lived
      through that day. (She did not finally take the morphia until sometime
      after five in the afternoon.) She says nothing about the day; and of
      course I ask no questions. But she was there in her room through the noon
      hours and all the afternoon. And when I asked her if she slept at all the
      preceding night&mdash;the night that I sat up, without even undressing&mdash;she
      said no.... But I think it is better for me not to dwell on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked over to the window to let the night air in on her, and perhaps
      also to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I recalled that there was a telephone downstairs. How stupid of
      me not to have thought of it before!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir Robert had spoken of a physician at the British Legation. I should
      have remembered that! But on second thought, I could not bear to think of
      calling in Sir Robert's man.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, medical advice of some sort I must have. I knew nothing of the
      action of morphia on the system. She might be sinking at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped back to the bedside and stood over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look worse to me. It might have been only the temporary effect
      of the strychnine and coffee, but there certainly appeared to be a hint of
      color in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going downstairs to telephone for a doctor,” I said, taking her
      hand. Her fingers twined weakly around mine, and clung a little. “Will you
      lie quietly here until I come back?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't want a doctor,” she breathed. “I'm much better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid no attention to this. “And will you promise me never to&mdash;not
      to”&mdash;my voice was unsteady&mdash;“not to take any more of that
      dreadful stuff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I could n't,” she replied, in that maddeningly unsatisfactory way of
      answering serious questions that women appear to have. “There is n't any
      more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I compressed my lips over this. But I went right downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager was in his little den behind the hotel office. I beckoned him
      out, and asked about physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sought my face. But I told him nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his assistance&mdash;for the telephone service of Peking is not that
      of New York or Chicago&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I called up an English medical mission that was not far from the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head physician had gone to bed. At first they refused to disturb him.
      But I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half an hour before he arrived. I drew a chair to Heloise's
      bedside, talking with her and rubbing her head and her forearms while we
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave every evidence of rather rapid improvement. She was weak, of
      course; and so nervous that her body would twitch for no reason, and the
      slightest unexpected sound would give her a start. But the pupils of her
      eyes, that had been very small, were widening out to something like their
      normal size. And behind the gaze that she kept turning to me and the
      occasional faint suggestion about her mouth of a gentle but sad and
      enigmatic smile, I felt, even then, that she was doing some sober
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have clung to one thought to-day. My life has been all a blunder. But
      it has helped a little to know that you have your scales, Anthony&mdash;and
      that you would n't have them except for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I went limp at this. For it had made me feel sound and strong to be caring
      for her, and now her words plunged me back into the depths of that
      dreadful day. I dropped my chin on my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony!” said she. “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only shake my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you have the scales, Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up on her elbow&mdash;all weak and shaking. She had on that gray
      silk kimono that I love&mdash;the one with the wistaria blossoms
      embroidered on it. I felt her eyes searching my thoughts, and I could only
      look at the soft gray blossoms on her sleeve and study out the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she was saying, with something of that musical “edge” in her
      voice&mdash;“Anthony, what have you done?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her. I even moved my chair aside and let her gaze past me and
      through the open doorway into my room, where she could see bits of the
      broken cylinders scattered about the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I pleading the cause of my love for her, of my&mdash;yes&mdash;of my
      desire for her, in thus giving way to the unexpected impulse to have her
      see those broken cylinders with her own eyes? God pity me, I do not know!
      All I am sure of is that I suddenly wanted her to know all about those
      miserable, weak hours of mine. And a strange, tremulous hope was
      fluttering to life in my heart. It was possible that we should again work
      together, she and I!
    </p>
    <p>
      This hope fluttered and grew. I felt my heart beat more quickly, and a
      touch of that odd dryness in the throat that comes to me when Heloise and
      I are close, when I touch her hand or her sleeve and know at the same
      moment that she is thinking of me and that her feelings are in some
      mysterious way interwoven with mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recall that I moved forward on my chair I moved still farther, and sat
      on the edge of the bed. I slipped my arm behind her head. I drew her
      lovely, dark head against my breast. I bent over and kissed her fragrant
      hair and rubbed my cheek against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was stroking her hair and her soft cheek. I bent lower and kissed her
      forehead. Then I kissed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help it. I did not know I was going to do it. I know now that
      she had stopped resisting before this. She let me kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly this fact made itself felt in my mind and in my heart. She had let
      me kiss her, but she had been unable to respond. And I remembered what she
      had said, hours or years ago, and the poignant sadness of it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something has died in me. I don't believe I can ever love a man again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I lowered her head against the pile of pillows. I held the thick braid of
      her hair for a moment, then let it fall over her shoulder. I looked into
      her eyes, hoping against hope that I might find a responsive light there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I sank back on my chair, and covered my face with my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out and laid her hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little time we sat that way. I could not look at her. I could not
      say anything. I was glad of the gentle touch of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she who broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony,” she breathed. “If I only could!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we were still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this would not do. I was all egotism&mdash;I, who had so wished to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I looked up, and took her hand in mine and stroked it. I even
      smiled at her. At least, it seemed to me that I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those moments that come, in our times of greatest
      bewilderment, when for a space we see clearly. I suddenly felt that I
      could think again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know what is to become of us, Heloise dear,” I said. “You have
      been close to the end of your life. But I think that you will have to let
      me help you. For I know now that I shall not want to live unless I can
      help you. And I shall not leave you alone in Peking. I think you will have
      to bear with me, at least until I can know that you have got back into the
      current of your life and work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She compressed her lips, and her dear eyes glistened. Then I felt her
      fingers tighten around mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said, low and uncertain, “I would do anything. I would love
      you if I could. I would go to you without love if I thought I could make
      you happy, or even help you. You gave me hope by helping me to work. Now,
      in spite of the dreadful facts of my life that I know so well to be true,
      you are stirring me to hope again. But all the time I know that the
      dreadful facts are there, that they will be there when this hope is
      faded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think,” said I, “that we can triumph over those dreadful facts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony,” she murmured, “if you only knew how dreadful they are. I
      wondered before whether I ought to tell you. I lay awake here night after
      night, trying to think it out&mdash;whether I ought to tell you. And then
      even worse news came. It was too much for me. I gave up, Anthony. It
      seemed to me, only a few hours ago, that the kindest thing I could do&mdash;the
      kindest thing I could do to you, dear&mdash;would be to leave this world.
      I brought only trouble into it. I thought it would be best to leave it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. She looked past me, toward the window. Her brows were knit.
      She was very sober. And her reticence, that I had always felt, was gone.
      She continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now I've made a failure even of that. And here I am again, disturbing
      your life, a burden&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaned forward and took her other hand and looked at her. She faltered.
      She stopped. I held her two hands firmly. For a moment I considered
      telling her that I knew her story. Then I knew that I could n't tell her.
      To-morrow, perhaps; but not now. This hour was hers and mine. Crocker had
      no place in it. I would not so much as have his name spoken. Further than
      this, my mind, that had failed me so miserably of late, was working again;
      and a plan was forming there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not yet see all the way. But from moment to moment I could feel my
      habitual confidence in my mental processes coming back to me. I was
      beginning to believe, as I always used to believe, that I should prove
      equal to the situation, as it might develop. And the first thought of
      renunciation was coming to me like a clear light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious, of course (even in this tense moment the fact became
      reasonably clear to me) that where personal desire is the major premise,
      logic is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time I came; in some degree to my senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must have seen something of all this in my face, when I bent forward
      and took her two hands so firmly and looked into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise dear,” I said, “you are not going to die. You are going to live.
      For the present you are going to let me help you start at rebuilding your
      life. You will do this because I love you, and because it is unthinkable
      that I should not help you. One way or the other”&mdash;I repeated this
      phrase with a peculiar emphasis that, I could see, puzzled her&mdash;“one
      way or the other I am going to help you. It may be that I can never stir
      you to love me. I shall do this if I can, Heloise; but it may be that I
      shall not succeed. I am glad that I have”&mdash;my voice broke here, so
      confusing is love&mdash;“have kissed you, but I shall not kiss you again.
      Not again, dear. We shall work this out, however. You and I, one way or
      the other, we shall work it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Anthony,” said she. “You must let me tell you! It is&mdash;I am not
      free&mdash;there is&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You shall not tell me to-night,” I said to her. “You shall tell me
      nothing. I will not permit it. I will not listen. Free or bound, however
      dreadful the facts may seem&mdash;these things are nothing. Nothing!” My
      voice rose a little, I fear, at this point. “They can not possibly concern
      us now, you and me. For one way or the other&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, dear, you don't understand&mdash;you don't know!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know enough,” said I. “I know all that need concern me and the woman I
      love more than my life, more than my work, more than everything else in
      the world and the sky.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed almost to shudder at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony! Please, dear!” She was whispering these broken sentences. “This
      is all wrong! Please!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trailed off. I was still bending forward, all eager and flushed
      with the great thoughts that were stirring within me. Her eyes seemed
      almost to cling to mine. She stirred a little, but did not turn away. Her
      hands were still in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that I ought to surrender her hands and sit back in my
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were glistening wet, the outlines of her mouth softened from the
      sadness that had been there. It almost seemed to me that she was drawing
      me forward with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly something&mdash;some quality of the spirit, perhaps, was draw
      ing me nearer and nearer to her. I knew that my head was bending closer. I
      thought of resisting, but I did not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lips met hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands slipped out of mine, and slowly&mdash;oh, so slowly!&mdash;slid
      up on my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her arms were about me, and my arms were about her; and our hearts
      were beating together, very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen!” she whispered, all breathless, turning her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was knocking at my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up, irresolute. I was bewildered. She looked wan and weak, lying
      back there against the pillows. I was choking back the sobs that nearly
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Heloise,” I managed to say. “I meant not to. Forgive me, dear!”
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not looking at me. “See who it is,” was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I went through to my own room, closing the connecting door behind me. I
      hurriedly brushed my hair, then opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the physician from the English mission. He was a young man, who
      looked at me coolly and with some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He weighed the morphine bottle in his hand, and pursed his lips over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She must have taken between ten and twenty grains of the stuff,” said he,
      musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, of course, is incredible,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head and replied in a casual tone for which I hated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no. An overdose will act that way with some people. The system simply
      refuses to assimilate it or even retain it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I reported to him what I had done. He then went in and looked at Heloise
      and asked a few questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally his eyes flitted about the shabby room. Then he would dart
      little glances at her and at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a depressing person, this young physician. It was clear enough the
      impression he got of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise felt it keenly. I saw that little droop of sadness coming about
      her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told me that I had done about everything he could have done, that
      she would be all right in a day or so, and that she had had a rather lucky
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left a little medicine, and went away. We both felt that he did not
      care to have us call him again; and we each knew that the other felt this,
      though we did not put it in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I said, after I had sat by her for a time in moody silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very late, dear. I rather think you will sleep to-night, in spite
      of the coffee and all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” she said, “I think I will. And you, Anthony”&mdash;she caught my
      hand&mdash;“I don't like to see you look so tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall sleep,” I replied. Then I kissed her forehead, and went into my
      own room, leaving the door ajar in order that I might hear if she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did sleep, both of us. At least, she says she did. And she looked
      rested this morning, when I took the breakfast tray from the waiter and
      carried it to her. She was up, and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have realized since that I did not succeed at all in my efforts to hide
      the serious mood that took possession of me from the moment I woke. She
      caught it. Every now and then she flashed an odd, puzzled glance at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, when we had finished and I had put the tray in my room, she
      broached the subject that was uppermost in both our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before we go any farther, Anthony dear, I am going to tell you&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Anthony, you must let me speak. You are giving up everything for me,
      and you don't even know&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know all I wish to know now, dear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But this is very important. I can't forgive myself, when I realize that
      you don't know what I have done&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could n't stand this. I simply took her two shoulders in my hands and
      made her look squarely at me; and I spoke with a sudden uprush of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, dear girl,” I said, “I'm not interested in what you have done. I am
      interested in what you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Anthony, if I am not worthy&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      It hurt me to hear her speak in this way. I was thinking swiftly,
      bitterly, of certain episodes in my own life. I was thinking of the men I
      knew, and what they had done. I thought of Crocker and his outrageous
      code. I thought of my own latest episode of the sort&mdash;with the little
      girl at “Number Nine”&mdash;and of the queer masculine twist in my own
      thinking that had led me to consider myself “unmanly” because I had run
      away from that girl when she wanted me to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I could not bear to have her speak or even think so of herself. So I
      said, still holding her there before me:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Men are accustomed to judge women, Heloise. You say that I must know what
      you have done. Has it occurred to you that I ought to tell you&mdash;very
      humbly, dear&mdash;what <i>I</i> have done?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked really puzzled at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why,” she said, “I don't know&mdash;I never thought. T have always heard
      that men were&mdash;well, different.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have heard that&mdash;from men,” I replied sadly, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught my arm. “But apart from all that, Anthony,” she broke out,
      “there is one thing that you <i>must</i> let me say. You <i>must!</i>” She
      hesitated, caught her breath, then plunged desperately along with it. She
      was not looking at me now. Her color was rising; and her voice low.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have&mdash;a&mdash;husband&mdash;” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” I interrupted her. “I am going to talk to him now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I went straight into my own room and got my hat and stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed me as far as the doorway. I saw her leaning there, all limp
      and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You knew!” she was murmuring, as if to herself. “You <i>knew!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't believe I shall need my overcoat,” said I, glancing out at the
      sunlight on the roofs. God knows why I said just that at such a moment. I
      added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait here, Heloise. It will be all right. But the time has come to stop
      drifting. We are going to stop drifting now, you and I&mdash;and he.
      Good-by, dear, for now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I must hurry. I simply could not talk this out with her now. I felt
      that I could not endure it. I doubted if she could. Besides it would get
      us nowhere so long as the question of Crocker himself should be left
      unsettled to menace our two lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came on into the room, reaching her hands out toward me. She seemed
      actually weak, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh&mdash;Anthony!” she breathed, staring at me with something that was
      almost fascination in her eyes, as if she were now seeing me for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not trust myself at all. I hurried out, closing the door behind
      me. I ran down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the thought of the telephone that had come to me with such force on
      the preceding evening. I knew now that it was not necessary to keep up
      this terrible waiting for him. It would be easy enough to call him up;
      then I could go to him and still feel that I was not leaving Heloise at
      the mercy of a chance visit from him while I was away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a long time for them to get him to the telephone, over there at
      the <i>Wagon-lits</i>&mdash;fifteen or twenty minutes, I should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I heard his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How are you, Eckhart?” he said, in the easy, offhand way that men employ
      one with another. “How have you been?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked God, under my breath, that he was in condition to talk. I simply
      could not have endured further delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I've been all right,” said I. “I want to see you, Crocker, in regard to a
      very important matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely. Any time you say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose I come right over there to the Wagon-lits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right. I'll wait for you in my room. Good-by.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-by, Crocker.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went out into the little Chinese street, and once again headed
      toward the big hotel in the Legation Quarter.

    <h2>
      April 14, (continued).
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ROCKER opened his
      door at my knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was half dressed, with a quilted gown drawn about his big frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gripped my hand. I permitted this, which was perhaps an odd thing to
      do; but it came about so easily and swiftly that I could not think how to
      prevent it without appearing merely childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went on into the room, and stood, with some sense of inner tension,
      while he drew an easy chair to the table and with a paper cutter pried
      open a box of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has changed, even in the fortnight since our parting in the railway
      station at Yokohama. He is putting on weight pretty rapidly, and his face
      distinctly exhibits the ravages of drink. It was pale this morning. His
      eyeballs were crisscrossed with red veins, and there was an incipient
      puffiness under them. His hands were unsteady, too; I noted that fact when
      he opened the cigars. And afterward, when he dropped on the sofa and
      settled back against the cushions, he extended his right hand as I had
      seen him do once or twice before, back at Yokohama, and make an
      unsuccessful effort to hold it still. Then he let it fall across his knee,
      and for a moment stared gloomily at the carpet.

      I observed, too, that he was more nervous. He moved with a jerky
      abruptness. And when he glanced up at me, it was suddenly, with a
      perceptible start, as if I had spoken sharply, though in reality I had not
      spoken at all. It made me think of the torturing confusion of moods that
      was racking his nervous system, and of the merciless voices of unrest that
      were so evidently whispering every moment at his inner ear. A few days ago
      I would not have observed his condition with any sympathetic
      understanding; but now that I, too, have been torn between the exaltation
      of love and the degradation of jealousy, I can only shake my head in a sad
      sort of wonder at the mysterious strength of these forces that drive men
      and women together, and apart, and that linger even after a mismating and
      a subsequent separation to stir and bewilder the spirit.... Yes, I can, in
      a way, feel with Crocker now. To live with memories of magical hours
      passed with a woman one has since lost&mdash;elusive, poignant memories,
      that come in the still hours of night to triumph over the brutal facts of
      the day that is gone and the day that is to come&mdash;this is the stuff
      of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My feelings soared far, as I sat there&mdash;all in a moment. I was
      thinking of strong passions and of elemental things. It came to me, oddly,
      that I had never really understood certain of the great poems and the
      greater music dramas. I told myself that I must seize the first
      opportunity to hear “Tristan” again. I would understand if now. Yes,
      surely... there was the surging, heartbreaking climax of the “Liebestod,”
      for example&mdash;it was surging in my feelings now, and in my brain. I
      could hear the swelling of the violins. And I knew all at once that it was
      not the mere heartbreak of Isolde and her Tristan that surged and swelled
      with them, I knew that it was the universal story of man and woman
      everywhere. Underneath the trivial vulgarity of the daily newspaper, with
      its commonplace recital of petty dramas and pettier tragedies, I suddenly
      knew, surge and swell the hopes and dreams and casual disasters of a
      million Tristans and a million Isoldes. It is men like Crocker and myself,
      I thought, and women like Heloise, who enact, all unconsciously, tossed
      helplessly about on great billows of feeling, the heroic drama of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the inner man that dwelt on these stirring things. The outer me was
      declining a cigar, and taking the easy chair, and for a moment letting my
      eyes w ander about the room. It was going to be pretty difficult to broach
      the subject. I could see that. Yet it had somehow to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bottle half full of whisky on the table, and glasses.
      Evidently the embargo had been raised. I could not help staring at that
      bottle for a moment. And, though he did not raise his eyes, I felt that
      Crocker knew what was in my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      His suit-case, with the cover thrown back, rested on a chair by the wall.
      The contents were rumpled about; but among them, right on top, I saw a
      knife-handle of Japanese lacquer and silver projecting from a lacquered
      sheath with a silver tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught me looking at it, sprang up&mdash;with an abruptness that made
      me jump&mdash;and slammed down the cover of the suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came back to the sofa with a short laugh that was plainly designed
      to cover inner embarrassment, and poured out a good three fingers of the
      whisky. He drank it neat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have some?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It settles my stomach,” he continued, with an air of apology. “I have n't
      been at all well lately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched him while he poured out another, and tossed it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where you stopping?” he asked. “Have n't seen you around here, have I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There's another hotel here, then?” said he. And his eyes narrowed
      craftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” I replied, “two or three.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I hesitated. But after all, why evade the man? I had come to his room
      with precisely the opposite intent. So, with a nervous abruptness not
      unlike his own, I gave him the name of my hotel&mdash;and Heloise's. And
      at the same time I watched him closely to see if it conveyed anything to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly it didn't. He merely blew out a long spear of smoke, followed it
      for a moment with his eyes, and then glanced down at the cigar that he was
      turning slowly round and round between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not sit quietly for any length of time. He got up again, with
      that same jerky abruptness, and, muttering something about the room being
      close, strode to the window and threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he was acting rather uncivilly, for he turned to me then and
      said, with a fairly good imitation of a casual manner&mdash;“Mind a little
      air?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all,” I replied. It was depressing to be talking thus about
      nothing, knowing so well what was in his heart and what was in mine. But I
      only mumbled the stereotyped phrase, “Not at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He took another drink&mdash;neat again. Then he drummed on the table with
      the fingers of one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is one thing above another that I abominate, it is that kind of
      idle drumming. He made it worse by whistling softly between his teeth a
      crude song of the streets. I knew that I must keep myself in hand, but
      could not help fidgeting a little in my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervously self-centered as he was, my discomfort quite escaped him, of
      course. What stopped his whistling and drumming appeared to be a sudden
      thought that came to him with the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at me. His eyes narrowed again. He opened his mouth, then
      abruptly closed it on the words that were so close to utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he did speak, I felt certain that his question was not the one he had
      meant at first to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How's the phonograph business?” he said, and tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's all right,” I replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the edge of the sofa, elbows on knees, and smoked fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What sort of place is that hotel of yours?” he inquired, after a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Middling. Not so good as this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Near by?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not far.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I suppose any rickshaw man would know the way,” he mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent again. Then, finally, he put the question that was on his
      mind, not looking at me, trying to speak casually; but his voice was not
      quite steady, and I could see the cigar shake in his hand:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you happened to see a woman over there&mdash;young, good looking,
      rather slender, blue eyes? Could n't say what name she'd be using.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash I knew that this was my opening. And on a great wave of relief&mdash;for
      we had to come to the issue&mdash;I leaned back in my chair and said,
      “There is such a woman there. She is using the name of Crocker.” Then I
      watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen a man's face go so blank. His jaw dropped&mdash;literally.
      And his eyes were wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself returning his gaze, and nodding rather emphatically. I kept
      on nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I said, holding his eyes with mine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “See here, Crocker, I know all about that. You told me yourself. Have you
      forgotten?” Slowly the recollection came to him. “Oh, yes,” he replied,
      “at Yokohama.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you told Sir Robert at Nagasaki. Have you forgotten that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to sting him. “How do you know I did?” he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He told me. We talked you over. I asked him about the legal possibility
      of placing you under some sort of restraint.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously, this didn't anger him. He merely looked puzzled. I wonder if I
      am doomed to remain ineffectual to the last&mdash;an odd, scientific
      little person, to be humored by the practical men of this rough-and-ready
      world, even in their least practical moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't get you, Eckhart,” said he. “What have you to do with my
      affairs?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At this moment&mdash;everything,” I answered him, feeling suddenly very
      sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad, because it came to me that you can not talk intelligently with
      another human being without a common language. And this, I knew all at
      once, Crocker and I did not have. I had thought of many things that I
      should say to him; now I had lost confidence in all of them, for I
      realized that the word which means one thought to me would mean another
      and different thought to him. Each of us would have to interpret words and
      phrases in the light of his own mental images. And the mental images of
      each were outgrowths of his individual philosophy of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, my arguments, that had, on the way over, seemed so potent, would not
      do now. In order to reach that mind of his, I must think in his terms and
      not in my own. And I tried, desperately, to piece together something like
      his code, as I sat there.... That man is a free and dominant creature,
      half god, half beast; that a small, sheltered section of womankind is of
      superior, almost divine stuff, designed to comfort and elevate man on his
      god side, to bear his children and, under his own general government,
      “keep his house,” while the other and greater section of this same
      womankind is mysteriously of poorer stuff, and is worthy only to do his
      rougher work at such a wage as can be wrung from him or (in a pitifully
      matter-of-fact way) to cater to the vices of his beast side&mdash;something
      like this was surely Crocker's sort of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to bring myself to realize what this meant. Holding so curious a
      faith, it was surely natural enough that he should have tried to force
      poor Heloise's life into his own hard mold of thought and habit. Nor is it
      unnatural that he should have been outraged when this lovely possession
      turned in despair from the atmosphere of suppression and inactivity in
      which he had been so determined to keep her and tried, blunderingly, all
      wrong, to find an outlet for the fine spirit stirring in the depths of her
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this was rebellion. And Crocker, I can see, hates rebellion. His sort
      always do. He is profoundly a conventional man, even in his vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought all this in a swift moment, as I sat there, wondering,
      wondering, how I could say the things that must somehow be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker waited as long as he could for me to go on, keeping himself busy
      with his cigar. Once I thought I detected a furtive expression on his
      face, as if he dreaded what was to come.
    </p>

      The man was conscious of his own inner weakness, of course. He must have
      been. Perhaps he remembered telling me of his solemn resolution to give up
      liquor. Even as this thought occurred to me, he reached out and again
      tipped that convenient bottle. It seemed to me that there was an extra set
      to his chin as he did this, a slightly overemphasized casualness that
      bordered on bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang to his feet and moved about the room behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for myself, I was cool enough. And, once I could hit on the proper
      beginning to the talk, I felt pretty sure that I could handle the
      situation. It is evident to me now that the plan I arrived at last night,
      there in Heloise's room, had cleared the air for me. For I knew&mdash;deep,
      deep in my heart I knew&mdash;that I stood ready to give Heloise up. There
      is selfishness enough in me, God knows. There will be moments of weakness,
      when the touch of her hand, the blue of her eyes or the shadow of her long
      lashes on her skin&mdash;perhaps even the mention of her name by some
      common acquaintance&mdash;will stir that strange magic that has, in such
      different ways, torn Crocker's heart and mine. But I believe I shall never
      again forget that the woman I love, has a life to build, and that the
      finest duty I have is to help her build it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard a rustling behind me. I turned. Crocker had thrown aside his
      lounging robe, and was getting into his street clothes. While I sat there
      watching him, he put on his waistcoat and coat. He put on his hat, pushing
      it back on his head. Then he busied himself transferring his pocketbook, a
      handful of small change, some papers and a key ring from the pockets of
      another suit that hung from a hook on the closet door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got right up and stood there, by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell you what, old man,” said he, rather apologetically. “I'm all out of
      sorts. Guess I need the outside air. You don't mind, do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” I replied, with a ring in my voice that was surprising even to
      myself. “I do mind. I've got something to say to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't talk about that,” said he, and walked to the open window, with his
      hands thrust deep into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I will talk about it, Crocker. It is what I came here to talk about.
      And I propose to make you talk about it, also.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered no reply; just stood there, staring out the window. I went on.
      I don't know now where the words were coming from that rushed so
      unexpectedly to my lips; but I knew, as I uttered them, that before either
      of us should leave that room he would be taking me seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is a woman over yonder, in the Hôtel de Chine,” I said “From your
      own confession to me, you have followed her here to kill her. There is
      nobody but me to talk to you, but you are not going to dispose of me so
      easily. This thing is going to be settled. It is going to be settled
      to-day&mdash;and without any killing, We are not living in that sort of an
      age, Crocker. Not quite.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean&mdash;settled?” he muttered, without turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Settled. Just that. And there won't be any murder. You and I are going to
      arrange terms of separation between Heloise and yourself. Then you are
      going home. You will leave this city before night. You may go either way&mdash;Tientsin
      or Hankow; it is the same to me. But you've got to go.... Will you please
      sit down here and try to discuss this thing like a rational man?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he did turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I suppose you think you can talk to me like this,” he said, with
      something of a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think just that,” I replied. “Sit down, please. We shall see if I can
      drive a little sense into that fuddled mind of yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there waiting. He did not move, except, it seemed to me, to square
      his shoulders. And there was the same set to his chin that I had noted a
      few moments earlier, when he was drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'm standing a good deal from you, Eckhart,” he said. “But after all,
      I've got nothing against you. You can't be expected to understand these
      things.” This evidently struck him as a happy idea, and he repeated it:
      “You can't be expected to understand these things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he frowned. “How'd you know her name was Heloise?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did I know?” I repeated. “I will tell you how. I will tell you much
      that you yourself do not understand.” My voice was rising. I had to
      struggle to control myself. But I knew that I must, for it was not myself
      I was fighting for now. “We will not waste words, you and I. We are past
      that, Crocker&mdash;far past it, if you only knew. I have seen”&mdash;the
      words “your wife” had come to my tongue, but I could not say them; it was
      a profanation even to think of that fine woman as “his”&mdash;“I have seen
      Heloise. I have come to know her. I have seen how sad she is, and what a
      struggle she has been making to begin doing something with her life. For
      she has been alone, Crocker&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. She did not stay with that other man. She could not. And she has
      been struggling all alone.” I fought back the emotion that was breaking
      into my voice. “I know you both now, Crocker&mdash;pretty well. And
      knowing you both, I can see, oh, so clearly, that she could never, never
      be happy with a man like you. She has ability, she has spirit, she has
      what they call temperament. She is an artist. And do you not know, man,
      that the artist must always be struggling toward expression, that his
      whole life is nothing but that struggling? You can not make a domestic
      drudge of such a woman. Of some women&mdash;yes. But not of the artist.
      You tried to do just that. You chose the woman who was beautiful to your
      eyes, and whose spirit made her most desirable, and then you tried to
      crush that spirit. I have no doubt she tried to submit, that she fought
      her own finest qualities, for years, in the hopeless effort to make of
      herself what you demanded. And then she broke&mdash;all helpless, all
      dependent on you as she was&mdash;and risked everything to get away from
      you because it was worse than death to her to be with you. And now you
      hound her around the world like the savage beast that you are.... Good
      God, man, can't you see that she was <i>right</i> in leaving you! Can't
      you see that it was the finest, bravest thing she could have done!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood, strung up, all blazing with the fire that was in me. I knew I had
      broken bounds. I thought that now, surely, he would turn on me and fight
      me; and I did not care. I even thought wildly of settling it all with him
      then and there, with blows, as men do. For I had the fire and the will
      within me; while he, with all his height and strength and native vigor,
      was palsied with that poison that eats away a man's will and leaves but a
      shell of bluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of anger on his face, as I stared into it, I saw only
      bewilderment. He seemed to be groping after the ends of a new concept,
      with a mind that had lost something of its power to grasp new concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good Lord,” he said then, “you're talking as if you were in love with her
      yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded at him, breathless and deeply solemn. “I am,” I said. “I love
      Heloise, and I shall love her with all my heart until I die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I was guilty of a tactical blunder in giving him this information.
      He was so evidently not himself that he should have been handled with tact
      and not further confused. As it stood, I had laid the train of a
      profounder confusion than I could possibly have foreseen. But I had to say
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still groping to comprehend this amazing thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't get you,” he said. He was not looking at me now, and seemed to be
      talking more to himself than to me. “You have n't known her&mdash;it's
      only a few days&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is nearly two weeks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you don't mean”&mdash;he fell to walking about the room, and I
      followed him with my eyes&mdash;“you don't mean to say&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, and pondered. Then he turned toward me; and it seemed to
      me he appeared more like his normal self than at any time since I had
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So you 're talking for yourself,” he observed, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” I replied, “I am not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you tell me you love her&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That does not stand in the way of my doing precisely what I insist that
      you shall do&mdash;give her up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's easy to say, Eckhart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not easy to do, Crocker. But Heloise must go to Europe, and take up
      her study. Her gifts, her hopes, all lead her straight toward opera.
      Neither you nor I has the right to stop her. It is the instinct for
      expression, nothing else. You have followed that instinct freely in your
      own life and work. I have followed it freely in mine. Now let her do the
      same. Work&mdash;the sort of work that will give scope to his own peculiar
      sort of energy&mdash;is what every human being needs. It is, above all,
      what Heloise needs. It will be her salvation, if anything will. Can't you
      get that into your head? She doesn't need any application of the punitive
      frenzy that we men call justice. She does n't need the easy moralizing of
      men like you&mdash;and me. She needs <i>work!</i>... As regards my giving
      her up&mdash;she goes to Paris; I stay here in China for at least two
      years. If you can think of any way in which I can put more miles than that
      between us, tell me, and I'll promptly give up my own plans and do it.”
      And I snapped my finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my phrases were over his head, I suppose. But he came back at me
      with a good deal of vigor, ignoring my intense mood:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “You tell me you love her,” he said; “and you talk about giving her up.
      You don't mean to say that you think she is in love with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      This sobered me&mdash;suddenly. I felt my eyes drop, and the hot color
      coming back into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk was turning on me in a way I had not precisely foreseen. But
      after all&mdash;it was only fair. Certainly I had shown no hesitation at
      exposing his hurt places. So I raised my eyes and looked squarely at him,
      knowing that, though it would be torture, I should tell him the truth as I
      had been coming to see it during these morning hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should hope not!” he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid no heed to him. The thing now was to get the truth out and have it
      over with.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There have been one or two moments when I dared think she was beginning
      to love me,” I went on. “But I was reasoning from my hopes. She was alone.
      She was destitute&mdash;desperate. There was no one she could turn to,
      except myself. She knew that I had come to love her. And hurt and crushed
      as she was&mdash;with all the gratitude that the biggest heart I have ever
      known could&mdash;But what is the good of this! What fault there has been,
      is mine. She is a buoyant, vital thing, an artist, all spirit and fire.
      Even in her suffering I can see that. There have been glimpses, when we
      were working and she could forget for a moment. I am a quiet man, a man of
      the study, a narrow man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, you <i>are</i> narrow,” he put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She must have variety. She must have stirring moments, strong reactions.
      She could not possibly be happy with me. And as for you, Crocker&mdash;well,
      we know about that. You are quite impossible. You thought you could
      possess her. Finding that you couldn't, you would kill her.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He winced. I was glad to see it. I must make him wince. I must show him
      that he was not only a brute, but an absurd one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went over to the bureau and rummaged nervously in the top drawer. I
      could see, in the mirror, that his face was working, in the way it has
      when he is deeply stirred. Then, after a moment of hesitation, he came
      back to the table, and with a fair assumption of an offhand manner reached
      for the whisky bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I snatched it away from him, sprang to the window, and threw it out, hard.
      I heard it break on the pavement below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I turned and faced him, wondering, with a swift uprush of excitement,
      what he would do. I had taken him quite by surprise, which was a point for
      me. His great strength had not enabled him to keep that bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first expression was a sort of hurt bewilderment. He took a step
      toward me, but without any particular evidence of anger&mdash;more as if
      he meant to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he turned, slowly and heavily, in the direction of the bell. This was
      over by the hall door. I ran toward it. A chair stood in the way, and I
      remember throwing it over in my rush. I had my back against the bell
      before he had got to the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He just stood there, trying to think. Then, abruptly, he turned back,
      dropped on the sofa, and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came across the room, as far as the table, and stood over him until he
      lifted his head. He was evidently fighting to keep from going to pieces.
      And his pride was not yet wholly gone, for he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “See here, Eckhart, I'm not feeling well at all. Just let me ring for a
      drink, and I'll talk with you. I will. I 'll talk. This thing has driven
      me wild. But you're right enough, I suppose. Just push the bell, will you?
      The thing has got to be settled. We'll settle it, you and I. If you think
      there's really any show for her, on her own, I'll be reasonable. It's been
      the thought of that fellow&mdash;of other men&mdash;Oh, God!” His face
      dropped again on his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that I began to feel discouraged over the prospect of
      arriving at any real settlement of the business. The man could not be
      counted on to remain in the same state of mind for two consecutive hours.
      I told him, in good round language, that he could not have another drop of
      whisky; and he exhibited self-respect enough (for the moment) to stop his
      whining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a little while I just sat on the edge of the table and looked at
      him. This was Heloise's husband. My spirit revolted at the thought. Her
      husband! The crude law under which we live actually gives such a man
      “rights” over that fine woman. It was unthinkable. And it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come out with it,” I heard him saying. “What's your proposition?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to think quickly. For this, after all, was the opportunity I had
      been so desperately seeking. I must talk straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are to let her have a divorce. If I know her at all, she will not
      accept alimony&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stuff!” said he. “Did you ever see anybody that would n't take money!”
    </p>
    <p>
      They were as far apart as that, those two. I pushed right on&mdash;“but
      she will have to accept something. A lump sum, say, on the ground that you
      have held back her training and limited her immediate earning capacity. I
      think, if that point is made very clear to her, she will be reasonable
      about accepting enough to carry her through her two or three years of
      study and the getting up of a repertoire. I would not ask her to agree to
      more than that. Not from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There, that was plain talk enough, surely, even for Crocker!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it pretty calmly. In fact, I am not sure that it wasn't something
      of a relief to his hard head to get down to what he would call “brass
      tacks”&mdash;meaning money, and the traffic in money.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's your proposition?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's my proposition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when do you want an answer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I must admit that he surprised me here. “Why,” I replied, “now. On the
      spot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said he. “You are asking me to agree to a plan that would change my
      whole life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the better!” I interrupted eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” said he. “Do you think I have traveled from New York to Peking
      for the purpose of changing my mind in one minute, because you ask me to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stiffened up, as he sat there, and was talking, all of a sudden,
      quite like a responsible business man. Whether this change was merely a
      momentary outcropping of self-respect, or whether there was man enough in
      him to bring that drink-fuddled brain so swiftly under control, I could
      not imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What else can you do?” I asked, as quietly and reasonably as I could
      manage. “At this moment you seem more like your real self, Crocker, than
      at any other time since I came in here&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'm myself, all right,” he broke in gruffly. “Never you mind about that.
      Let me hear your arguments.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “&mdash;and you can't sit here, and look me in the eye, and tell me that
      you seriously consider carrying out the insane purpose that brought you
      here. You can't, man!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cut that talk out!” he cried angrily. “Stick to your own side of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no other side of it, Crocker. You're not going to kill her.
      She'll never go back to you. Your only possible course is to give her up.
      And my guess is that you'll show yourself a reasonably good sport.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This touched him. At last I had hit on a phrase that he could understand,
      in all this ugly talk that I was driving so desperately at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind that, either,” he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up, and looked at him. It seemed to me that I had him. Certainly,
      he was avoiding my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked out his watch, and stared at it, turning the stem around and
      around between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's eleven-fifteen,” he said, then slowly let the watch drop back in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had smoked the last of his cigar. Now he lighted a fresh one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll give you my answer at two,” he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I did not know what to say to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What's the matter,” he said, in that rough voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a voice, I imagined, as he would employ with business
      subordinates. “What's the matter? Isn't that reasonable? You've stated
      your proposition. I'll think it over and give you my answer after lunch.
      If I accept it, I'll pack up and leave Peking on the first train.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I hesitated. He just sat and smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know what's the matter,” I replied, finally. I decided to stick to my
      policy of talking in his own blunt way. “How do I know that you will be
      sober at two?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll be sober,” said he. He thought this over, and added, “After all,
      Eckhart, I suppose you have a right to ask that question. I'll admit that
      I've been making a dam' fool of myself. I've been drunk ever since I got
      here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “I know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This disturbed him a little, but he went on&mdash;“I'm glad you threw that
      bottle out. It was what I needed to bring me to my senses. I'm all right
      now. You 'll see. Tell you what I 'll do&mdash;I'll take a cold bath. That
      always sets me up. Then I'll order up a lot of coffee with my lunch, and
      only a light wine.” He got up, and stood over me. “There's my assurance
      that you'll find me here, O. K., at two. I'm not a common drunkard,
      Eckhart. You're not a man of the world, and you don't see these things
      quite as they are. I've been stewed, that's all. I'm through. Now for the
      coldest bath they've got.” He began stripping off his clothing. “Come
      right in at two. Don't bother to send your name up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I could only look up at him. I must admit that he was
      convincing. What he said was quite true&mdash;disordered as he had been,
      through passion and drink, he was not yet a common drunkard. There was yet
      stuff in the man Besides if, as I was beginning to hope, he really meant
      to accept my plan, the less than three hours he asked for was a quite
      reasonable concession to his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to make the decision. I did make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right,” I said, “I'll come at two.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked straight at me, and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You've helped me, I think,” he said, in a very decent spirit. Then he
      glanced down at his big hand, and added&mdash;“Better take it, Eckhart.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it. Then, stirred by doubts and hopes so extreme and so confused
      that I hardly knew what I was thinking, I went out. The last I saw of him,
      then, he was throwing aside his under-wear, and exposing a deep chest,
      with big muscles curving down over the shoulders, and smaller ridges of
      muscle in rows on either side. And on his face was that set look.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran up the stairs (at the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>) and burst into my own
      room. Then I stopped short, and took off my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there, by the window&mdash;in my room&mdash;stood Heloise. She wore a
      simple but very beautiful frock of her favorite color, blue. It made her
      look taller, and slimmer, and more exquisitely womanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room itself was changed. She had picked it up, and given it what few
      cheerful touches she could. On the bureau, in the toothbrush holder from
      my washstand, stood a spray of white cherry or pear blossoms. I can't
      imagine where she got them; I did not think to ask, when we were together,
      for we had so much else on our minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bureau, also, in a neat little pile, were the pieces of my ten
      broken cylinders. She had gathered them all and put them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time she had ever tidied up my room like that. It touched
      me. I stood motionless for a moment, looking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you see him?” she asked, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, still looking about the room, “I saw him. It is going to be
      all right, Heloise&mdash;all right. We are to meet again at two.” Then I
      indicated the white blossoms. “You have made it seem almost like a home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh&mdash;that?” she murmured. “It was hard to wait. I had to keep myself
      busy.” She said it very gently. And it thrilled me to realize that,
      whatever strange event might come to her and to me, we had at last arrived
      at a fine spirit of companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just to think that she could do this friendly act, feeling in her heart
      that I would not misinterpret it or in some crude masculine way take the
      advantage&mdash;I like that, even though I distinctly do not deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was speaking, still in that low voice, but breathlessly, I
      thought:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “How will it be 'all right,' Anthony? What do you mean? What have you
      done?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that I must be very gentle. But with her, as with that man over
      yonder in the other hotel, it was the time for frank talk. For as I had
      insisted with Crocker, her life was her own to live; and I could not go on
      now without her approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew my one comfortable chair to the window for her. She took it. Then I
      explained to her, just as briefly as I could, that Crocker had agreed to
      consider setting her legally free, on condition that she go to Paris and
      work out her career independently of myself or any other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard me without a word, sitting there, her hands folded in her lap. I
      could not make out the expression of her face. It was grave, of course,
      but composed&mdash;with no sign of the hysteria that I had considered as a
      possibility. Indeed, I am not certain but what she was rather calmer than
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had said it all, and had paused, looking anxiously at her, she
      asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “How long have you known about him? Did <i>he</i>”&mdash;she indicated the
      room across the hall with a slight movement of her head&mdash;“tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained to her that I had been with Crocker on the ship and at
      Yokohama, and that he himself had talked to me of his difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This surprised her, I could see, but she made no comment regarding it. Her
      next question was uttered with hesitation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Was he&mdash;did he seem&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught her drift. “To-day, you mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, with compressed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has been pretty bad, but I really think he is sobering up. When I left
      him, he seemed to have himself under control. And he gave me his word that
      he would be sober at two, when I go back.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be musing, in a depressed fashion. Then she glanced up, met
      my eye, and tried to look brighter. “The trouble with him is,” she said,
      “you can never be sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” I replied, “but I could n't refuse to give him three hours&mdash;less
      than three hours. You see, dear, there is no pressure I could bring upon
      him. I have n't even the advantage of physical strength. And, really, you
      know, when you come right down to it, my whole position was the weakest
      possible&mdash;I had absolutely no right to talk to him like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We fell silent again. Finally she turned squarely around, and leaned
      against the casement, and gave me her hand. I saw then that there were
      tears in her eyes, and deep sorrow, but about her mouth there were
      evidences of a strong determination that explained why the tears did not
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me,” she said, “what becomes of you in this arrangement?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” I replied, “I stay here and do my work. There is just one thing I am
      going to ask of you, Heloise&mdash;will you help me make the scales
      again?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked surprised, I thought: and her mouth twisted 'nto the faintest
      of smiles. Then she nodded. “Yes,” she said, “we will make the scales.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't you see,” she went on, “that what you are trying to do brings us
      closer together than years of ordinary, selfish love-making?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “in a way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In every way,” said she. “Are you blind, Anthony? Can't you see how you
      are making me love you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tore my hands away from her. I could not stand it. But my brain was
      still dear, thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise&mdash;dear!” I cried, “this only makes it harder. We must play
      fair. We must see it through. If he goes back to America, then you must go
      to Paris, and I must stay here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What if I should refuse to go to Paris?” said she, still looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will not do that,” I answered her. “For it is the condition on which
      he will set you free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what is to prevent my waiting for you there&mdash;one year, two
      years?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will be too busy to wait&mdash;you will be working, growing, changing&mdash;yes,
      you will change. You will not need me then. Your life must not stand still
      because of a man who loved you away out here in Peking,”&mdash;I said this
      as steadily as I could,&mdash;“it must go on, and on, and&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said she, “you think I would do that. You think I would change.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. “Life is change. And you are full of life. Sad as you have been,
      dear, I can see that. I am a narrow man. If you came to me, I would be
      weak enough to want you by me, in my home. I should want&mdash;children. I
      should want you to be my wife, my helpmate, my&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well...” she breathed, with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Heloise, whatever you may think now, I could never forget what I
      should be shutting you out from, and it would make me unhappy. Don't you
      see, dear? You must follow your own genius. That is what I am trying to
      help you do.” And I added sadly, “It is the only way out for you, anyway,
      because it is the only course that he will agree to&mdash;if he should
      agree to anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony,” she said, “is all that true? Is it just the old conflict
      between one's own personal life and the career that one is drawn to? Don't
      you suppose I could give my life to helping you and be happy in it&mdash;so
      happy that it would make you happy too? Thinking of those days that we
      spent working together, it has seemed that way to me. Just to-day it has
      seemed so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. “You have a great gift in your voice, Heloise. It must be
      used. It must grow greater. You are unsubmissive, a rebel; which is
      precisely what an artist must be. You have the spirit of a fine artist.
      You must cultivate and expand that spirit. There is nothing ahead of you,
      Heloise, but work&mdash;hard, hard work. And loneliness. That is the lot
      of the artist. But it will bring its compensations. And even the work
      itself is a great opportunity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” she said, “I know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you must not weaken, dear. You have headed that way&mdash;you must go
      straight on now. And I will live in your success.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does it really come down to that, Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It comes down to that. You've got to do it, anyway&mdash;you have no
      choice. I am only bringing up these reasons now because they may help you
      to think it out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps this is my real punishment,” she observed, “losing you just when
      I have found you.” And then the tears came to her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” said I. “Perhaps not. If so, it is a punishment for being
      alive, since, one way or another, every human being must face it. Every
      life has to be lived, you know, dear. It is hard to live a life&mdash;straight
      through to its end. It is still harder if one fails to live it.... And
      then, this applies to me, as to you. There is no more reason that you
      should give up the proper direction of your life than there is that I
      should give up mine and follow you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” she said, with a little gasp, “I never thought of that!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is so, Heloise. We are both positive natures. We have each a life to
      live. Let us try to live them honestly and thoroughly. Perhaps, in doing
      that, each will one day make the other happy and proud.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We paused. And then Heloise, being a woman, turned swiftly back to the
      practical aspect of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Anthony,” she broke out, “you don't for a minute suppose that I
      would let you undertake all that expense for me? You don't really think I
      would accept it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it had to come; the money business, that I had shrunk from mentioning
      when I told her of my talk with Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated, then blurted it out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must pay you a reasonable sum to cover that expense.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh&mdash;Anthony!” Her eyes flashed fire. “I won't touch a cent of his
      money!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But&mdash;but&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not one cent!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I felt very sordidly masculine as I stood there trying to explain.
      I gave her the reasons, as I had thought them out&mdash;that it was mere
      justice to recompense her for the time he had forced her to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my voice began to falter, as I ran on with the jargon; for I saw that
      she was not listening. She had become very white. She leaned against the
      casement, all limp and sad, gazing out over the roofs. Her breath was
      coming more quickly. And I saw her draw her under lip in a little way
      between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My voice trailed off into silence. For I suddenly knew that she was
      thinking of her own utter helplessness. And as the fact tortured her nne,
      free spirit, so also it tortured mine. I reached my hand toward hers;
      then, since she did not see, withdrew it. There could be no help for
      either of us in that contact&mdash;nothing but a deeper confusion. Then I
      turned and walked away across the room, and sat gloomily on the edge of
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must have remained silent for several minutes. It seemed an hour to me,
      as I sat there, brooding, and struggling against the tendency to brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard her step, and her voice; and looked up to find her standing
      over me. She was actually smiling&mdash;a resolute smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forgive me, Anthony,” she said. And then, before I could exclaim at this,
      she added, enthusiastically, like the girl she often seems&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let's make the new scales now!”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I could only look at her, wondering at her astonishing
      buoyancy of spirit. Then, as she was herself carrying my phonograph to the
      table and adjusting the horn, I got up&mdash;still heavy and a thought
      bewildered&mdash;and brought a box of cylinders.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was at this, she walked a few times to the window and back,
      swinging her arms freely, like a boy, and inhaling deep breaths. Her
      collar evidently confined her throat, for she tore it open with an
      unconscious vigor that displaced a hook and sent it flying against the
      window. She seemed not to notice this. She swung up on the balls of her
      feet and ran through a number of vocal exercises. It thrilled me to hear
      again that wonderful voice, with the firm resonance and the fine quality
      that always, to me, makes her seem something more than woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's a wonder I can bring the tones out at all,” she observed, half to
      herself. “I have n't sung a note for days.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Next she began running scales; very carefully and precisely, her eyebrows
      puckered into an intent frown. And I watched her white throat, and round
      chin, and delicately curving mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught me looking at her, and flashed a smile at me. Then, with her
      eyes on mine, took in a quick deep breath that filled her chest out
      solidly, and, full voice, broke into the old familiar waltz song from
      “Romeo and Juliet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew then that I had never really heard her sing before. She saw the
      surprise on my face, I know, for her eyes suddenly sparkled anti sprung
      away from mine and she flushed with pleasure; but she went right on with
      the song&mdash;sang it clear through, managing the lace-like coloratura
      work with perfect ease and precision, unconsciously throwing her whole
      body into the glorious, swaying rhythm of the waltz, and letting out a
      volume of tone&mdash;of sheer, luscious tone, without a particle of “wood”
      in it&mdash;that filled the room, that would have filled the greatest
      opera house in the world, that throbbed about my ears and set my emotions
      vibrating in harmony with it and with the mood of the singer that animated
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had done, I stood motionless there. It seemed to me that echoes
      of that wonderful voice were still floating to my sense-consciousness from
      every quarter of the shabby little room. I know that I hail to look out
      for a moment at the sunlight on the roofs beyond the window, and myself
      take in a deep breath that, I fear, was half a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must get to work,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a cylinder on the machine. First I looked at her and tried to speak,
      but could not. I don't know what it could have been that I thought I
      wanted to say. Probably it was nothing more than the inarticulate emotions
      her singing had stirred, groping for some outward expression in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were very bright. I motioned her to go ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have n't wound it up,” she said, and chuckled softly. I can not
      account for her moods. But, for that matter, I think I chuckled with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made twelve records. I believe they will prove to be even better, on
      the whole, than the ten I destroyed. So, whatever happens, I have again my
      close-interval scale; again I have the selfish gratification of knowing
      that I have been enabled to establish a basis of scientific interval
      comparison for the use of all students of primitive music. It is Heloise's
      last gift to me, done in a strange sort of joy that, even to-night, breaks
      triumphantly through the shadow that lies on her life and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched me while I removed the last of the twelve cylinders, and
      carefully sealed it in its separate box, and wrote the label. Then she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony, it is so&mdash;worth while!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All I could say in reply&mdash;so full was my heart&mdash;was:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, dear. Work is the answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so close were we now, that I knew she did not think my reply inept.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her watch, then soberly reflected. “It is half past one,
      Anthony,” she said. Conscious that I still found some difficulty in
      talking, she added: “Would it do any good for me to go&mdash;with you, or
      alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said I, shaking my head. “Not now. It would only excite him. And
      that would help nobody.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” said she. “I hate to be passive, this way. I feel as if I were
      shirking&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are n't. It will take some courage to do what you must do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” she said again. “Be patient, keep steady; help you that way I
      know, Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It had occurred to me, when I left Crocker in the morning, that, in the
      event of any actual physical encounter, there would be a quite unnecessary
      danger to me in wearing my glasses. I thought of this again, now; and
      going to the bureau I got my spectacle case and slipped it into my coat
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise watched me, but asked no questions. I put on my hat, and took my
      stick from the corner by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-by, Heloise,” I said. I knew that unless we parted swiftly my will
      would weaken and I should take her in my arms. So I only said good-by, and
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she came right forward, and took my hand. Our eyes met. What I saw in
      hers reassured me. She seemed very steady and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said, “I have been selfish, and weak. I have made it hard
      for you. But you can count on me now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to murmur a protest to this, but she swept on: “I am going to do
      whatever you decide for me. I shan't make any more difficulties. Now go.
      God bless you, Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped my hand, and stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there and fumbled the door knob. I felt that I was almost
      certainly going to draw her to me and kiss those wonderful eyes that are
      the light of my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she still looked strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wonder,” she said, musingly, “if there was ever, anywhere in the world,
      a man exactly like you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned away. “You'd better go,” she said, with a little gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker was not in his room, at the Wagon-lits. I knocked several times;
      then, turning the knob and finding that the door was unlocked, walked in
      and looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to leave when the thought of that sheath knife came to me. It
      was an unpleasant thought; but once it had got into my mind I could not,
      it: seemed, get it out. I stood there in the middle of the room, thinking
      about it. The suitcase was still on the chair by the wall, closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a step toward it. Then another. Then, suddenly conscious of my
      weakness, I went over to it and threw back the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knife was not there. I rummaged through the garments and the odds and
      ends that filled the suit-case. But the knife was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rushed out of the room and ran the length of the corridor. I hurried
      down the stairs; looked about the office and lounge; went to the bar.
      There was no sign of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was turning away from the barroom door, when I realized that a fat man
      was beckoning to me from a table by the opposite wall. He was sitting
      alone, an empty liqueur glass before him. Across the table was another
      empty glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beckoning violently, with his whole arm. I had seen that round face
      somewhere. Then I remembered. He was on the ship with us, crossing the
      Pacific&mdash;the vaudeville manager from Cincinnati&mdash;played fan-tan
      all the lime. I never did know his name. He wore a genial grin now.
      Perhaps he would have some information for me. At least, I could ask him.
      So I crossed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrung my hand. “How's little Mr. Music Master,” he cried. “Sit down.
      Oh, sure you can&mdash;sit right down there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my watch. It was ten minutes of two. I had said that I would
      be at Crocker's room at two. It was pretty important that I should keep my
      word. Why could n't I think more clearly? He might be somewhere about the
      hotel, of course. If only the knife hadn't disappeared! Suddenly I wanted
      to rush back upstairs and look through that suit-case again. The knife
      might have slipped down one side. Yes, he might have done that in getting
      something else cut of the suit-case.... Come to think of it, I had n't
      looked in the dining-room!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I heard what the fat vaudeville manager was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember the Port Watch? Big fellow&mdash;walked the deck so much&mdash;and
      kept a sort o' slow bun sizzling all the time? Well&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Have you seen him?” I asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sure, right here. Not five minutes back. Had a couple of drinks with me.
      But say, I don't think he knew me. He acted funny&mdash;walked and sat
      very erect&mdash;looked solemn and did n't say much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which way did he go?” said I, trying to appear composed. But I felt him
      looking quizzically at me, as if saying to himself, “Well, here's another
      of 'em.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did he have his hat?” said I, on the heels of my other question.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. I think he went up to get it. Funny thing. I did n't make out what
      was the matter until he pulled out a big knife&mdash;in a lacquered
      sheath, it was&mdash;and said&mdash;what was it he said?&mdash;Oh, yes&mdash;'They
      pretty near put it over on me, but I'm too smart for them.' That was it.
      He whispered it, real mysterious&mdash;'They pretty near put it over on
      me, but I'm too smart for them.' Do you know, he made me feel damn
      uncomfortable. I think the man ain't safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to all this, in a way. At least, I seem to recall it now, word
      for word. But I was trying to decide whether to go upstairs on the chance
      of heading him off there, or to hurry directly back to the <i>Hôtel de
      Chine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided on the latter course. I think the vaudeville man had just about
      uttered the last sentence recorded above when I turned and ran out of the
      room. He must have been puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I ran. One or two of the drinking crowd shouted after me, I think. I
      ran down the corridor, through the lounge, and out to the street. T
      remember that two Chinese hall boys stood gaping as I passed. And parties
      of tourists looked up from their after-tiffin coffee and their drinks&mdash;always
      the drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leaped into a rickshaw, and called&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Two plecee coolie! Two piecee coolie!” And then, when one brown-legged
      ragamuffin had picked up the shafts and another had fallen in behind the
      seat, added, still in a shrill voice, “<i>Hôtel de Chine</i>&mdash;chop,
      chop!”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incongruous, that absurd pidgin-English at such a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was effective. I have never traveled so rapidly through the streets
      of Peking. I found two Mexican dollars in my pocket, and held them up, one
      in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chop, chop! Chop, chop!” I cried again. And the coolies put their heads
      down and ran with all the strength that was in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up in my shabby little street, with a jerk that nearly threw
      me out. I sprang down, threw the two dollars on the seat, and ran into the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      For standing by the clerk's desk, looking over the board that hung there
      with our names&mdash;Hel-oise's and mine&mdash;in plain view, stood
      Crocker. He was peering closely from line to line down the first column of
      names, guiding his eye with an unsteady forefinger. He stood up very
      straight, with feet placed a little way apart. From the side pocket of his
      coat projected the silver tip of the knife handle, beneath which I could
      see a half-inch of black lacquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew my spectacle case from my pocket, took off my glasses, and
      carefully put them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was intent on the list of names and room numbers. Behind the counter
      stood the little French manager, leaning forward and watching him rather
      coldly. But Crocker was oblivious to all but the one idea; his finger
      wobbled slowly downward from name to name.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse was to go directly up to him. But what then? What could I
      say or do? He was past reason, surely; but not past the use of his
      physical strength. He had been every bit as drunk as this when he knocked
      the waiter down in the hotel at Yokohama. What if he were to knock me down
      in the same way&mdash;with that sudden, short swing of his fist to the
      chin? I would of course drop as the waiter had dropped, and, like him,
      would lie inert, leaving Crocker free to rove at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      My eyes turned to the stairway, up and down which I have walked or run so
      many times during this eventful week.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the place. I would at least be above him there... if I could pass
      him and reach it safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped forward, cautiously
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager was watching me as well, now, with knit brows. But this was no
      time to consider him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocker was having some difficulty in reading the list of names. His
      finger went back to the top of the board, and again began wobbling slowly
      down from line to line.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tiptoed past him. He did not turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on up the stairs, but not quite to the top. T hank God, Heloise did
      not know&mdash;not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point I could not see him. I waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally&mdash;it seemed a long time, but I suppose it was not more than
      two or three minutes, really&mdash;he appeared at the foot of the stairs.
      He was swaying a very little. On his face was the crafty expression I had
      seen there once or twice during our talk in the morning; his eyes had
      narrowed down to slits. Curiously enough, he was still pale, not red, as I
      should naturally expect in the case of a man as drunk as he. If he saw me
      at all, waiting there a little way from the top of the stairway, the sight
      of me meant nothing to his disordered mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed one foot on the bottom step, stopped and put his hand to his
      mouth (standing motionless, as if trying to think), then brought out his
      knife. He drew it from the sheath. It had a wicked blade&mdash;designed
      for desperate, primitive uses, I should say. The sheath he returned to his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a curiously set, almost businesslike expression on his face, he
      came running up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I blocked the way, holding out both arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed me aside. But I clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an effort to jerk away from me. I said something to him; I don't
      know now what it was, but I remember that I was very careful not to raise
      my voice. I think he didn't reply at all; just kept on pulling away from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I clung. I did n't know what on earth I could do. There could be no
      agreement, no arrangement, with this wild man. Everything had gone to
      pieces. All my hopes for Heloise had been snuffed out in a moment. And the
      thought that my grip on his arm was the only thing intervening between her
      and a fate that I can not even bring myself to think about, almost stops
      my heart, right now. Then, of course, there was no time to consider even
      that; I just clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he must have caught hold of the rail at first with his right hand,
      to steady himself as he silently tugged and jerked; for it was a moment
      later that he struck me. I had swung around partly behind him,
      fortunately, and the blow glanced off my head. It made me feel giddy for a
      moment, but it was not effective. We tottered, and I think he caught again
      at the rail to keep from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hung desperately to his thrashing arm, pillowing my head behind it to
      keep out of his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking down, I saw his feet, the left a step below the right. I
      hooked my right foot around his left ankle, and, with all my strength,
      pulled it toward me. I felt his leg give. I pulled harder; made one great
      convulsive effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tottered, and fell slowly backward, carrying me a little way with him.
      Then I found myself sitting jammed against the wall, with a dazed, aching
      head, while he slid clear to the ground floor and lay there, on his back,
      his left leg doubled under him in a curiously unnatural way. The manager,
      I remember, stood over him, very white, pulling with rapid little jabs at
      his mustache, and saying nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an oddly silent affair, from beginning to end. I remember looking
      anxiously upward in the fear that Heloise had heard and run out. I dreaded
      the look of anguish that would surely be on her face. But she was not
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew myself to my feet. A few steps below me lay the knife. I picked it
      up, then went on down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some China boys were bringing a cot. They lifted Crocker, very carefully,
      and laid him on it, then carried him into the office. He must have been
      suffering intense pain; but he only set his teeth hard, and once or twice
      drew in a quick, hissing breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed them in, and stood over him. After a moment he rolled his head
      around and looked at me. I could see that he was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where am I, Eckhart?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Hôtel de</i>&mdash;That's where&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is where I am stopping,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whitened, and winced; whether in physical or mental pain I am unable to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My leg is broken,” he observed, a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who did it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He knit his brows. Then he saw the knife in my hand, and bit his lip. It
      did not occur to me, then, to put the knife away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were silent again. Then&mdash;“Take me to the Wagon-lits,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” I cried, “we will take care of you here,”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, and again bit his lip. “I want to go to the
      Wagon-lits,” he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In one moment, sir.” It was the manager, talking over my shoulder. I
      stared; for I had not heard him approach. “In a moment, sir. The
      automobile, it will be here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it was better so, if he could stand it. And doubtless he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking again at the knife in my hand. I held it up and stared at
      it. There was a little blood on it, near the point. He reached out, and I
      gave it to him. It was his property, not mine Very deliberately he drew
      the sheath from his pocket, put the knife into it, and thrust it into his
      side pocket. But he thought differently of this; for a moment later, when
      he thought I was not looking, he transferred it to his inside breast
      pocket. I wondered a little at this. Then it occurred to me that he feared
      it might be observed by others, there in the side pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      An automobile drew up before the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have telephone for the doctor,” said the manager. “It is that he will
      await us at the Wagon-lits.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we carried Crocker out on his cot&mdash;the manager, three Chinamen,
      and I. He was very heavy. And they took him away. He did not look at me
      again, or speak to me. And I, of course, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated outside the door of my room, trying to think out what I should
      say to Heloise. But I could not think very clearly. Neither could I stand
      there indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in, opening the door very softly, and closing it softly behind me.
      My principal thought, at the moment, was of getting across to my bureau
      and brushing my hair and straightening my tie before Heloise should see
      me. I could not bear to think of coming before her with these visible
      evidences of the struggle upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I could not get beyond the bed. I sank down on it, leaning against the
      footboard. I was sitting this way when Heloise came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came swiftly toward me, a hundred questions in her eyes. She never
      before looked so lovely to me as standing there before me, blue of gown
      and eye&mdash;all blue, it seemed to me&mdash;something flushed with
      excitement, her under lip drawn in a little way between her teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony,” she said, low and breathless, “you are hurt!”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. But she was staring down at my left hand, that lay on my
      knee. My gaze followed hers. There was blood on my wrist. It must have run
      down my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She helped me take off my coat, and with a small pair of scissors that she
      got from her room cut off my shirt sleeve at the shoulder. It was wet and
      stained with red.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gash in my upper arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up the arm and looked closely at it. I liked the direct,
      practical way she went about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is n't an artery,” she mused, studying the wound. “Not a big one,
      anyway.” And she washed it, and drew it together with plaster from my
      emergency kit, and bandaged it very neatly. Then she helped me to lie down&mdash;brought
      pillows from her own room to place behind my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not ask one question; just worked to make me comfortable. Finally
      she sat on the edge of the bed, and critically looked me over.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You'll be all right,” she said thoughtfully. “I know one thing that is
      the matter. We both forgot all about luncheon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” she went on, “I feel a little faint myself. I couldn't think what
      on earth was the matter until it came over me all at once that I've eaten
      nothing to-day but one very small breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I let her ring for the waiter and order food. During this space of time I
      lay still, trying to think how I should tell her. Every moment it grew
      harder. But at last I caught her hand, when she was passing the bed, and
      drew her down beside me. She knew well enough what was on my mind, but she
      only stroked my forehead with her soft, cool fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this time, so pregnant for her, and so painful, she was thinking how
      she might spare me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her exactly what had taken place; clumsily enough but, at least,
      clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been there in her room all the time, and had not heard a single
      unusual sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say much, beyond a thoughtful question or two. The tray came,
      and she arranged the little meal as attractively as she could, there on
      the edge of the bed. But we both grew more and more sober as the moments
      went by. The thought of poor Crocker in acute physical pain, that once
      splendid body of his crippled and useless, disturbed us both. I was glad
      to see that there were tears in Heloise's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the belated luncheon I felt distinctly better. At four o'clock I got
      up. Heloise, who was doing her best to keep busy about her own room, came
      to the door and suggested a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It won't hurt either of us,” she added, with a wan smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went out and strolled over to that great thoroughfare, the Hata High
      Street, where the yellow people swarm, and the uniformed police direct the
      traffic with an almost Occidental sense of order, and the long brown camel
      trains from Mongolia and Kansu pad softly over the very modern pavement
      and under the electric street lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stayed out until nearly six. But our spirits did not rise as we had
      hoped. For whatever way our thoughts turned, they found no light. We did
      not have to talk about this; now and then our eyes met, and that was
      enough. Heloise was strangely, almost completely passive. Even in such
      trivial matters as picking our way through the traffic&mdash;where, I
      know, it would be natural for her to look out for herself in that brisk,
      self-reliant way that young American women have&mdash;she would turn to me
      for guidance, and press against my arm. She watched me a good deal, too,
      to make sure that I was not becoming tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we came back to the hotel. As we ascended the stairs I slipped my
      arm through hers. She looked up at my touch, and tried to smile; and her
      eyes seemed to cling to mine for a moment. In the dim light I could feel
      them as well as I could see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened my door, and stepped aside to let her pass in. Then we both
      stopped and looked down at a white envelope that lay on the sill. I picked
      it up, then entered and closed the door while she switched on the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned the envelope over and over in my hand. She watched me for a
      fleeting second, almost timidly, then went into her own room to take off
      her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope bore the imprint of the hotel. I opened it, and read the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is with regret that the management begs to inform you of a previous
      engagement of rooms 16 and 18 for the 15th instant, necessitating that the
      rooms be vacated by that date.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise came to the door, and stood there observing me. She was tucking
      back a rebellious strand of hair; and she looked very slim and girlish,
      standing that way with both arms raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went over to the casement window, and threw it open. Then I sat down by
      it, on one of the chairs of bent iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came toward me, disturbed but hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed her the paper. She read it, standing very st ill. Then she looked
      up. Her face twisted a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, Anthony,” she said, with a catch in her voice, “we 're put out of
      the hotel!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence ended in an odd, explosive little laugh. Then, abruptly, she
      slipped to the floor beside me, threw her arms across my knees, hid her
      face on them, and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing I could say, of course. The matter was absurdly
      unimportant compared with the grimmer uncertainties before us. Yet it had
      hit me with almost the same force.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid my hand on her shoulder. I stroked her head. After a little she
      groped for my hand with one of hers and, when she found it, clung tightly
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time I was thinking how like a child she seemed. I believe
      that is the supreme quality of the artist&mdash;childlikeness. It is a
      quality that carries the adult worker through hells of suffering and
      heavens of unearthly joy; and it is a quality for which small allowance is
      made in this particular world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It will soon be dawn. I have written almost all night. Probably now I had
      better try to get some sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to the door&mdash;hours ago. There was on her face that new
      passive quality; I can not define it exactly, even in my own thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said, with choirs of suppressed music in her low voice,
      “would it be better, tomorrow you know, for us to...” She had to begin
      again. “Do you wish me to go away from you? You must tell me&mdash;not
      what you want, but what you believe is best.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only look at her for a moment. I could n't think at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise dear,” I said finally, “I don't know what is best. But I know I
      can't let you go. Not yet. Not with everything uncertain, like this. We'll
      look up another hotel in the morning.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She pursed her lips. Then, with a look of sober relief that she could not
      altogether control she slipped back into her own room. And I closed the
      shrunken door behind her, and hung my raincoat over the narrow opening
      that was left.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E are in another
      dingy little hotel&mdash;off to the eastward of the Legation Quarter,
      opposite the German wall. We packed our trunks last night. It is forlorn
      business, of course. But Heloise has not seemed greatly depressed. I
      suppose that any activity is a relief to her spirits after the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is out now; and I am a little worried. The situation has switched
      about rather oddly, it appears, within the hours, and it is I who must
      play the passive rôle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly after breakfast we rode over with our band luggage and engaged
      these rooms. I left Heloise here, and myself went back for the trunks. It
      took me some little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned, I found a note in my room. Heloise had suspended it by a
      string from my chandelier, where I could not miss it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only a few sentences, penciled in haste. She feels that she
      must see Crocker herself. And now that he, poor fellow, has lost the
      advantage of his greater physical strength, they can meet as equals, in a
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is natural, I think&mdash;and right. There would have to be a
      meeting; I can see that now. But it is not so easy to sit quietly here. I
      can do nothing, except to go on writing until she....
    </p>
    <p>
      They are calling in the hall. I think they want me at the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Heloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still to wait. She asks it; and I will. And she is right. It is the
      only thing to do. This is her task, not mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a task for her slender hands&mdash;alone there in the great hotel
      where men drink and bargain, where tourists swarm, where women parade!
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could know something of the details, and of what is to be done.
      If I could only help!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said. “He is gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gone!” I repeated stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He died this morning, Anthony. He was not alive when the automobile
      arrived here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” I blundered on, “I don't understand&mdash;it was a bad fall, but&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not the fall,” she said. Then, “Wait there, I shall need you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the click that cut me off, but for a moment I just stood there
      with the receiver still pressed to my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I myself who had let him have the knife.

    <h2>
      <i>April 15th. Night.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ELOISE called me
      over to the big hotel this noon, and we had a little talk. I was glad to
      find her completely mistress of herself. She was very grave, but she had a
      direct, practical way about her that, I could see, had instantly commanded
      respect among these strangers. One thought that had worried me not a
      little during the hours of her absence was that she might have difficulty
      in identifying herself as Crocker's widow. But it was evident that no such
      question had arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me that there was some uncertainty as to whether the American
      Minister or the Consul-General at Tientsin should be brought into the
      matter, and asked me to speak with the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was down in the main corridor, near the office, waiting for an
      opportunity to do this, when I encountered the Cincinnati man. He rose
      from a table, in the lounge, and crooked his finger at me. I joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced about to make sure that no one was within earshot, then said,
      talking around his cigar: “I saw them bring him in. Is he dead?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Looked like it. Too bad.” He lowered his cigar and pursed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do the job himself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thought so. The idiots brought him right through here, with the knife
      lying on top of the robe. Pure luck that it happened to be morning, and
      nobody much around. I've been looking him up. It's awkward&mdash;awkward
      as hell. I saw his wife. You want to keep her out of the publicity, I take
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was not unkind. He was studying me with shrewd eyes,&mdash;I knew
      that,&mdash;but he was so physically big and solid, and so plainly a man
      of affairs in that rough, practical world that Crocker himself had
      inhabited, that I found myself leaning on him. He could help. And, as I
      returned his quiet gaze, I knew that I could trust him. I realized, all at
      once, that the code has its good side as well as its bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has there got to be publicity?” I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He squinted his eyes, took a thoughtful pull at his cigar, and nodded.
      “Rather,” he replied. “Everybody knows the Crocker family. And this fellow
      himself has been on the front page now and then. Publicity? Good God, man,
      stop and think a minute! He's dead. And death is one thing you can't hush
      up so easily. I know our newspaper boys&mdash;and I know <i>that</i>....
      Look here, suppose I take hold with you. Glad to do what I can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded at this, and said&mdash;“I wish you would.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right. But tell me first, is Mrs. Crocker all right? The
      correspondents are sure to get at her, you know. Can she meet them, and
      keep cool?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “she can do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze lingered a moment on my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought so,” he replied. “She looks like the right kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little time he sat back in his chair, smoking and meditating. Then
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll get the Consul-General on the wire and ask him to come over himself.
      We'll have to tell him everything, but I think we can satisfy him&mdash;I
      can bear witness that he was drunk and making threats. So can you. The
      little Frenchman from the other hotel must have seen the thing. He
      sputtered around like a crazy man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “Crocker was alive when they started over here in the
      automobile.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I gathered that. Well, we can give a pretty complete story, among us all.
      I don't know just how much you can tell, of course, but I advise you to
      come out with everything you know. Then, when we are all together, we can
      agree on what we'll give to the press. The managers of both hotels will be
      glad to keep it quiet. And the Consul-General's all right&mdash;he'll help
      us out to that extent, I think. You see, there's no public interest to
      consider, nothing to hide but news. It's the lady being involved, you
      know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked a moment longer, then concluded:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think we can swing it. You go up now and advise the lady to keep very
      quiet and follow instructions, while I'm getting Tientsin on the wire.
      Then meet me here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came down, twenty minutes later, he met me with a cheerful sort of
      steadiness and led the way to a corner of the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The old boy's coming himself,” he said, as we dropped into chairs. “I'm
      dam' glad. This is no job for student interpreters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments we talked along in a desultory way. We had to wait for a
      few hours&mdash;no escaping that. I could see that the Cincinnati man had
      assumed the task of keeping me occupied, and I liked him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his card, by the way. His name is
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann. He has large interests in vaudeville theaters through the Middle
      West.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we chatted, my share in this strange drama of Crocker's life and death
      seemed to be clearing itself up in my mind and taking form as a narrative.
      Hindmann had advised me to tell everything to the Consul-General. I was
      wondering how I could ever do it. For one moment I even thought of handing
      him my journal and asking him to read it. The next moment, of course, I
      realized how impossible it would be to do that&mdash;for this most
      intimately personal of my belongings is no longer mine; it is more than a
      part Heloise's. And the story I tell the Consul-General must be only my
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not an easy thing to do&mdash;disentangle my share in the tragic business
      from Heloise's and my joint share, and tell only that much while still
      telling the truth! It is a little out of my line, this lawyer-like sort of
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have appeared rather distrait to Hindmann. But if I did, he ignored
      it. He just sat and smoked&mdash;a comfortably fat, round-faced man with
      shrewd, steady eyes&mdash;and talked along in an easy manner. He told me a
      good deal about his vaudeville business, I remember, and the curious
      problems that are constantly arising out of the invasion of the
      entertainment field by the moving pictures. I think I expressed some
      interest, now and then, even asked an intelligent question or two; but all
      the time that story was arranging and rearranging itself in the back of my
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I found myself beginning to tell bits of it to him. After all, why
      not? He would hear most of it anyway, before night. Then, after a little,
      it all came rushing out; and I realized that I was making a confidant of
      this fat man. It had to be, I think. Surely every human being, at certain
      intense moments of his life, needs a confidant. And I suppose there is
      never any telling, in a given case, what sort of individual will be chosen
      for the trust. Crocker chose me&mdash;and Sir Robert! I chose Mr.
      Hindmann, of Cincinnati... sitting there in a corner of the lounge of the
      <i>Hôtel Wagon-lits</i>, talking in a low voice in order that the little
      groups of American and British folk and Germans might not hear the details
      of the love that has so very nearly' torn my life to pieces. The usual row
      of Chinese merchants were over against the wall, I remember, with their
      glorious display of embroidered silk coats and skirts and scarves and
      squares hung higher than their heads. Once a great Mandarin walked by and
      bowed impersonally to us, attended by a dozen or more of lesser Mandarins
      who bowed in their turn; and they all wore stiff-fitting frock coats, and
      American shoes, and silk hats that came down almost to the tops of their
      ears!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann said very little&mdash;just listened, and smoked. Then, when I
      had finished, he turned away, looked rather steadily out the window, and
      muttered something about its being a queer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, when it was about time for the Consul-General to arrive, he
      advised me to tell only of my earlier acquaintance with Crocker, of his
      drinking and his declared intent to do murder, of my happening to be on
      the stairway in the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i> when he came running up with a
      knife in his hand&mdash;and the rest in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” I protested, “the Consul-General will suspect. There are too many
      coincidences in that story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course there are,” said Hindmann. “And of course he'll see through
      them. He was n't born yesterday. But he won't say anything about that.
      Neither will you. And there you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Consul-General, with his secretary, arrived at four o'clock. He took
      possession at once of Crocker's effects, locked them in his room and put a
      seal on the door. Then he called all of us before him in the manager's
      private office&mdash;the two hotel men, Hindmann and myself&mdash;and in
      the course of an hour's steady questioning drew out the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which I and the hotel men withdrew, leaving him with Hindmann for
      another hour. I don't know what was said; Hindmann has not referred to it
      since. But a messenger was sent to the Legation and I know that the
      Consul-General himself did some telephoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One curious fact came out during the examination in the manager's office.
      Before the automobile had got out of the little Chinese street on the way
      from the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>, Crocker borrowed a pencil and wrote a few
      hasty sentences on the back of an envelope. The Consul-General asked for
      the paper; but no one had thought to look for it. It proved not to be in
      Crocker's pockets. The automobile was called; and there, sure enough, it
      was, on the floor of the tonneau, just where he had dropped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had written&mdash;“Don't send me home. Bury me in China.” It was dated,
      and signed. The Consul-General thought this over and finally suggested a
      temporary interment at Tientsin, unless Mrs. Crocker should have other
      plans. He said that the matter of a lot could easily be arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann told me at dinner that the Consul-General is perplexed over
      Heloise's standing in the matter. While outwardly he is considerate to a
      fault, he explained privately to Hindmann that he can not recognize her in
      any official way. He is going to send Crocker's effects home under seal,
      for the courts to dispose of as they may decide. He suggests that Heloise
      employ counsel to look after her interest in his property. There is, of
      course, no hurry about this; it will be a year, or two, or three, before
      the estate can be wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann was right about the newspaper correspondents. It seems that
      several of the largest American papers have their own men here. The great
      news agencies are represented, of course. And all these men got at us
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find this experience perhaps the most disturbing of all. They are very
      insistent, these reporters. They make me curiously uncomfortable.
      Underlying all their questions is a morbid eagerness to uncover a
      sensation, to make their “stories” as thrilling as possible. Several of
      them, I think, firmly believe that Crocker was murdered. They have picked
      up something of his recent history. They know that he was pursuing
      Heloise, and that he was drinking. Fortunately, none of them appears to
      connect me with the story in any intimate way. They are all on the trail
      of that other man, the man with whom she came to China. I realized to-day
      the curious fact that I do not so much as know the name of that man I am
      glad I don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they will have to accept our version, I believe&mdash;the simple fact
      that Crocker took his own life in a fit of despondency. There are only
      seven persons alive who know further details, and only four who know the
      whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the reporters forced their way to Heloise this evening. It was just
      after eight. I was in the lounge, waiting for Hindmann. I could n't bear
      to think of dinner, but was trying to drink some coffee and eat a little
      toast. The usual evening crowd was swarming about me, talking every
      language under the sun. A China boy brought a chit. It was just a line
      asking me if I could come upstairs, signed “H.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The management had given her the use of a small suite on the second floor.
      The door to her parlor was ajar, and I heard voices. I knocked, and she
      called to me to come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the two reporters, hats in hand. Heloise was standing by the
      table. She was pale, but very erect and composed. She had put on a black
      tailored suit. It was this, perhaps, that emphasized the ivory whiteness
      of her skin, and subdued the blue in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she saw on my face indications that I was about to speak
      indiscreetly. For I was. The sight of the reporters in that room, trying
      to pin Heloise down to the details of this dreadful story, angered me. But
      before I could utter a word she took command of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forgive me for calling you in this peremptory way, Mr. Eckhart,” she
      said, “but I cannot talk to these men. You were good enough to offer to
      help, and, since I am alone here, I am forced to take you at your word.”
      Then she turned to the reporters, adding, “Mr. Eckhart knew my husband.
      You will please talk with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was steady; but my quick eye caught a familiar, listless gesture
      of her left hand as she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Mrs. Crocker,” persisted the older man, “it has been said that&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw the door wide, and sprang directly in front of Heloise, facing the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0309.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      “Get out!” I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned, but backed toward the door, as I advanced on him. Thus I got
      them out into the corridor. I was all ablaze. But at the door I turned for
      one brief glance at Heloise. Her lips were compressed. She gave me a swift
      look of warning. This steadied me. I closed the door, and walked down the
      corridor after the reporters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come downstairs,” I said, “and ask your questions of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So I myself came nearer to an outbreak than have any of the others. But I
      shall not lose my head again. And after one or two days, Hind-mann tells
      me, the news value of the episode will have flattened out, and they will
      let us alone.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E are going down
      to Tientsin on the forenoon train for the funeral. Then back here before
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise herself has seen to all the little necessary arrangements. She had
      me get what few flowers I could last night. And I believe we can get more
      in Tientsin. She wants to do everything she can for his memory in these
      last hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she is very fine about it. She exhibits no weakness. She shirks
      neither from what she regards as her duty in this tragic time nor from the
      results of her own acts. It has all come back to her, of course, in a
      thousand memory-shapes. It must have. But she does not speak of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister sent over a large bunch of lilac blossoms last night, cut

    <h2>
      <i>April 17th.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E came back to
      Peking on the late afternoon train&mdash;Heloise, Hindmann and I. But
      Hindmann stayed in the smoking car most of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise and I sat in our compartment without saying much of anything. The
      sober spell of the funeral service was on us both. I bought some magazines
      at Tientsin, and laid them on the seat close to her hand. She picked one
      up, and turned the pages, but without much interest. In a few moments she
      laid it aside. Most of the way she rested her head back in the corner of
      the seat and watched the little brick stations flit by, and the Chinese
      farms with their mud-walled compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time I went forward and joined Hindmann. I thought Heloise would
      be glad of a little solitude. Then there was a chance that she might sleep
      a little. But I don't believe she did, for when I looked in on her, half
      an hour later, she was sitting forward, chin on hand, studying the flat
      brown countryside with its occasional squares of green millet-spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't go away again,” she said, her eyes back on the brown and green
      fields and the dingy gray compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since she was not looking at me, and seemed not to expect a reply, I
      just dropped down opposite her and myself gazed out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little she spoke again, with some uncertainty in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll move my things back to our little hotel&mdash;first, Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have shaken my head, for she added, more resolutely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must, Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be trying for you to stay on at the <i>Wagon-lits</i>, of
      course,” I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It isn't only that,” said she; then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not only that, of course. The poor child was, is, penniless. But
      this was something I could not talk about. For the first time in many days
      there was an awkwardness between us. Certainly I felt it, and I think she
      did. We could n't quite think out what to say. We had been in the presence
      of death, and love seemed a petty, selfish thing. And back of this,
      something had happened that I don't quite understand now. We have no
      longer the poignantly intimate sense of apartness from the world that we
      had during those strange, wonderful days at the <i>Hôtel de Chine</i>. The
      world has thrust itself between us. I can see now that we were a million
      miles away from actual life, over there in our two little rooms with the
      shrunken door between. We did not know it then; but we were. We have
      become self-conscious. Many things flitted into my mind to say, but I
      could not say them. They were all unpleasantly flavored with
      Consuls-General, and big, noisy hotels, and newspapers, and legal
      disputes. It was depressing to think that we could no longer slip
      unnoticed about the quaint, barbaric old city. We are known now;
      conspicuous, even.
    </p>
    <p>
      And woven through all these thoughts, deep in our common consciousness,
      hovered that brooding mystery of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right, Heloise,” said I, “we will get your bags back to-night. The
      first thing. And we won't hurry about straightening out our plans. Wait a
      few days, until you feel more like facing things. What you need now, I
      think, is some rest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. “I don't need rest, Anthony. Goodness knows I have
      strength enough for six women. I can face things. No, let's plan now. What
      do you want me to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat there for several long moments, trying to think how to say it. I
      remember that I rubbed my forefinger back and forth along the windowsill,
      through the dust, and followed it intently with my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she asked, still gazing out the window&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think I ought to go to Paris, Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. Then, as she was not looking at me, said&mdash;“Yes, I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how, Anthony? How on earth can I? Everything is mixed now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” said I. “But I've been thinking that out. We can do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said she; “but don't you see&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not becoming easier. So I broke out with my conclusions:
    </p>
    <p>
      “In its essentials, dear, our plan is not changed at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's absurd, Anthony!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. What has happened has merely deferred the payment of that money.
      Ultimately it will have to come to you. Something, surely. I will advance
      it.” She moved restlessly. I hurried on. “You will give me your note and
      an assignment of your claim on the estate. I&mdash;I will charge you
      interest, Heloise. It will be perfectly businesslike. These things are
      done every day. Really.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no good talking on. She had turned her face away, and, under
      pretext of resting it on her hand, was hiding it from me. I forgot what
      she had said about not leaving her again, and stumbled out of the
      compartment and went back to Hindmann.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not return until he told me that we were approaching the outskirts
      of Peking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, as she had before. Then I helped her on with her coat, and
      gathered up the magazines. We stood there, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I said&mdash;“Well, we are n't quite there yet. We may as well sit
      again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the train slowed down, and dallied along by jerky stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” said she. “I've been thinking, you never saw him in his younger
      days. He was a very likeable man, dear. He got on with people. And he was
      a good business man. Big and bluff, you know, and strong. I&mdash; I've
      been thinking&mdash;we should n't have married, he and I. That was a
      mistake. I was too young to know what marriage means. And he was very
      positive. But I can't help wishing you had seen him&mdash;before. I really
      think you would have liked him, Anthony. Strong men always did.... You
      don't think it strange of me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise, dear,” said I, “I've been thinking the same strange thoughts. I
      did like him. He never really knew what he was doing. Even after what
      happened&mdash;what he tried to do&mdash;I have n't been able to feel any
      hatred. No, not even anger. Nothing but a queer sort of sorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Anthony,” she breathed, her eyes shining. “<i>Do</i> you feel that
      way?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said&mdash;“I've wanted to ask you.... It's difficult... did he
      know about&mdash;us, Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could n't say much now. But I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on mine; her lips were parted. “You told him, Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” she cried softly&mdash;with immense relief on her dear face&mdash;“oh,
      Anthony, I'm so glad. Because he never could have felt in that terrible
      way toward you. He did n't, Anthony, did he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train rolled into the station-shadows, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because,” she was saying in my ear, as we moved slowly out into the
      corridor, “hard as he was sometimes, and positive, and all shaken and
      tortured, even he knew the real things when he found them, Anthony. It
      would have hurt him, but he would have been fair&mdash;once he could
      really get it clear.” And she whispered, right there in the corridor of
      the car, with passengers crowding behind us and before&mdash;“I'm so glad
      he knew it was <i>you!</i>”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann tells me that we passed Sir Robert to-day in the railway station
      at Tientsin. It seems that that old man and I actually brushed sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did n't know this. Did n't see him at all, in fact. But Hindmann says he
      looked straight at me, without the slightest sign of recognition&mdash;first
      at Heloise and then at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a young woman with him; a rather good-looking girlish person, very
      thin, but “with a way about her.” Hindmann has seen her before. He thinks
      she ran a gambling club in Macao when he was last on the Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert himself impressed him as looking extremely old and not a little
      feeble, with a slight paralysis that has twisted his face up curiously on
      the left side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad I did not see him. I hope I never shall.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HELPED Heloise
      get her things back to our little hotel last night. Then I packed a bag
      and came over here and took a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did n't say anything when I told her I was going to do this. But I am
      sure she realizes that it is the only thing to do. It disturbs me to think
      of her alone over there. But now that she is known to half the white
      people in Peking, I will not permit myself to stay there with her. I will
      not have her talked about on any new grounds. And now that I am beginning
      to understand her, I see clearly enough that I must protect her. Lately it
      has seemed to me that none of the more artificial restraints that society
      accepts as necessary details of a working code mean much to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begin to think that in certain fine ways women are more primitive than
      men. In the sense, I mean, that their deeper emotional nature lies closer
      to the roots of life than ours does. They are more elementally natural,
      harder to sophisticate. They feel more swiftly and surely, without the
      elaborate intellectual machinery that men find it necessary to call into
      use in order to arrive at conclusions. In certain respects they are deeper
      and bigger than we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read all this in the books, of course&mdash;years ago&mdash;but
      never before believed it in the sense that belief implies personal
      experience and understanding.

    <h2>
      <i>April 18th. Morning. (At the Wagon-lits).</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES, I was right in
      moving over here. Heloise admitted it to-day. I asked her if she did n't
      agree with me, and she said she had come to think that my judgment is
      better than hers in these matters. God knows, I am unworldly enough&mdash;sometimes
      I feel that she and I are nothing but a couple of babes in the woods of
      life&mdash;but at least I am a bit more worldly than she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I was right in insisting that we go right on with our plan, as if
      nothing had happened. I have forced myself to go over the whole difficult
      business, thinking it out step by step; and I was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>is</i> a difficult business. Sometimes, at night, when my
      imagination slips out of control and dream-pictures come of a home of my
      own, it is almost more than I can bear. Last night I had to switch on the
      lights and work until daylight over the notes for Volume Six. (That is to
      be the section devoted to “True Intervals and Natural Song.”)
    </p>
    <p>
      I am driving myself to think constantly of the other side of the picture&mdash;to
      realize how beautiful Heloise is, what a person she is and what a voice
      she has. No home that I could conceivably offer her would be large enough
      to contain her life. And when I construct in my mind the years during
      which she would have to fight her own inclinations, deliberately confine
      her activities and build barriers against the growth of her own soul, my
      resolution strengthens. If it is hard to give her up now, it would be
      impossible then. I know myself well enough to know what I should be and
      do, then. I would be jealous of her very bigness. I would, likely as not,
      come to hate her beauty, her voice, her capacity for work. I would fight
      to make a <i>Hausfrau</i> of her, with babies, and meals to get&mdash;meals
      for me!&mdash;and sweeping and dusting to look after. And then, should I
      succeed in that miserable purpose; should I have to realize, every day and
      every night, with her beauty fading and with that wonderful edge on her
      voice becoming blunted and the tones growing uneven and foggy, that I had
      shut her out of the chance for growth that God gave her&mdash;this, after
      she had already taken one desperate, tragic step toward freedom&mdash;should
      I find myself forced to live, day after day, year after year, with any
      such realization as that, I think the time would come when I would want to
      kill myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who deliberately stops a woman's growth&mdash;no matter what his
      traditions and beliefs; no matter what his fears for her&mdash;is doing a
      monstrous thing, a thing for which he must some day answer to the God of
      all life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As civilization stands now, the woman who marries shuts herself out from
      the possibility of a career. Not in every instance, of course; but
      certainly in such an average, modest marriage as mine would have to be. I
      have some means, of course; but not nearly enough. And it is not likely
      that I shall ever “make” money in any large way.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I really don't believe the thing can be done. Not yet. I like to hope
      that some day the world will become more nearly civilized as regards
      marriage. But first we must make it less a matter of land and houses and
      goods, and of woman as property along with these. And I think we shall
      probably come to some system of paying woman directly for the great
      service of child-bearing and rearing. Yes, we men must give up the last
      shreds of our thought of woman as a personal possession. We are farther
      from that, still, than we realize, I think. I myself am far, far from it.
      Where Hel-oise is concerned, I know perfectly well that I am not to be
      trusted. God only knows what I would do, what I would come to think and
      believe. For the magic that is always between us would be confused in a
      thousand subtle ways with the heritage, of deep-lying racial habits that
      are in me as in every other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at least, I have come to see it. For this I am thankful.

    <h2>
      <i>Late Afternoon. (still the 18th.)</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ELOISE understands
      now. And she agrees that I am right. She will accept the loan I suggested.
      And she will go to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called up this afternoon&mdash;while I was writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said, “take me for a walk. It is stuffy here. I want some
      air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she started out, and I met her near the eastern end of Legation Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just a little walk, Anthony,” she said. “I'm not getting any exercise
      these days. I don't seem to want to go out alone any more.... Up on the
      wall, Anthony, where we can feel the wind. And there won't be so much
      dust.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So we climbed the ramp, and walked from the Hatamen to the Chienmen and
      back&mdash;two miles. South of us extended the Chinese city, that lies
      outside the historic stronghold of the Manchus. Northward, as far as we
      could see, stretched the Tartar capital, now all fresh green foliage with
      bits of curving tile roofs peeping out in gray-brown patches. For Peking
      is a city of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could see the brick walls of the Imperial City, and, within that, of
      the Forbidden City itself; with its acres of glazed yellow roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tartar wall is all of fifty feet high, and nearly as broad on the top.
      Grass grows there; and there are parapets, and the casual ruins of stone
      barricades where men have fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Heloise, while we walked, that I had worked it all out. I told her,
      too, of a curious coincidence of this very morning. I picked up a magazine
      in the hotel lounge, and, turning the pages, found my attention arrested
      by an interview with some great singers. In that paper the three finest
      living operatic sopranos agreed that marriage, home, domesticity, could
      play no part in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt it my duty to tell her about this. We simply have got to face these
      facts. And I must help keep up her courage with my own. Once she finds
      herself established at Paris, her work going on, the stimulus of new
      acquaintances and of fine music and of the stir and rush of the Western
      World all about her, it will not be so hard, I think. At present, the
      loneliness, the sense of distance from her own kind, and the perplexing
      reactions of the tragedy that we have both had to pass through, combine to
      bring her deep emotional self closer to the surface than normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, she is quite dependent on me. We do not speak of this;
      but I know well enough that it is every moment in her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not stay out long. It is most difficult when we are together. I am
      going to start my own work at once. It is the only way to keep steady&mdash;I
      can see that. I have letters to the American Minister. I shall present
      them tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lingered at the door of her hotel. Neither of us wanted to say good-by.
      We stood there for several moments without speaking. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you come in?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a few slow steps into the doorway; then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall not change, Anthony&mdash;in Paris!” she said, and hurried in
      without looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I have succeeded in getting reservations for her on the Trans-Siberian,
      leaving Harbin on the 23rd. That means starting from Peking on the 21st&mdash;in
      three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      She says that she will not mind the long journey alone. I wish I knew of
      some American or English family that is going through to Moscow on that
      train. But I feel pretty sure that she will make the acquaintance of some
      fairly congenial group of tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I think of troubles that may come to her in case she should meet
      with no such good fortune; and then my head becomes hot and I have to
      clench my hands and walk out in the air. There will be men of course&mdash;and
      ten long days of that train! Certain ugly phrases of Sir Robert's float to
      the surface of my thoughts and stay there to irritate me. I can't help
      dwelling a little on the sinister code of the white men who travel in the
      East.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is no good thinking of these things. Heloise says they are only the
      chances of life, and that we have to take those. “And Anthony,” she added
      to-day, “they can annoy me, but they can't hurt me&mdash;they can't make
      any difference.”

    <h2>
      <i>April 19th. Noon.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SENT one of my
      letters of introduction to the American Minister to-day, by coolie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied at once, with a cordial chit asking me to tea this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find that Hindmann knows him. and has spoken of me to him. It turns out
      that the Minister regards himself as something of an amateur in Chinese
      music. He knew my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He showed me a big book,” said Hindmann, in telling me about it, last
      night. “Had a lot of queer music scales in it, and pictures of
      instruments. He said it was the standard authority on the subject.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What book?” I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don't remember the title,” said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But think, man! Think! Who wrote it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did n't notice that, either. Some German, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That can not be,” said I, with some excitement, I will admit. “Neither
      Boag nor von Stumbostel is within five years of publishing the results of
      his researches. I am nearer it than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My first volume, 'The Origins of Musical Sound,' stands now in galley
      proof and will be published within two years. No, no, no! There is no
      German work that is the authority on primitive music. There is, as yet, no
      authoritative work. Van Haalst, Elton, Père Avard, and twenty others,
      merely pointed the way. All of them pointed the way wrong in certain
      important respects. No, if there is an authority, it is myself. I am the
      standard authority. The Minister does not know what he is talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seems to me,” he observed, “it was published at Bonn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At Bonn!” I shouted at him&mdash;“At Bonn!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes&mdash;I'm sure it was Bonn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not the book of von Westfall?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That's it,” said he, nodding. “That's the guy&mdash;von Westfall.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So the influence of that scoundrel has penetrated to Peking! He has
      actually got himself regarded as an “authority”! I did n't know what to
      say or think. But Hindmann calmed me down a good deal. He has a steadying
      influence on me, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You needn't sputter at me,” he said. “I did n't write it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” said I. “But I was not thinking of you. I do not know what to
      do. I was to have had tea with the Minister to-day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” remarked Hindmann, around his cigar, “why not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?” I repeated. “It is impossible. This man will wish to talk my
      subject&mdash;my subject!&mdash;with the work of that charlatan at his
      elbow. No, I will not talk with him. I can not. Don't you see?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Hindmann, “not exactly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am at once placed in competition with one that I know to be an absolute
      impostor. The Minister will take seriously what he regards as his own
      views. But they will not be his own&mdash;they will be the views of von
      Westfall. Don't you see? I can't go!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann sat for a little while, smoking and thinking. He has a very
      comfortable way of settling his plump person into a big arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look here,” he said. “You want to go over there. It's worth doing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid I sniffed at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is,” he went on. “So what you want to do is to go right ahead with
      it. Don't be licked by a book.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He did n't quite understand me there. I was not “licked” at all, and I
      told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Prove it by going, then.” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I'm afraid I shall insult him. I shall have to say what I believe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go ahead and insult him, then,” said he; and he took out his cigar and
      grinned cheerfully.

      <i>Same date.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> GOT Hindmann to
      help me out with the notes and the assignment of her interest in the
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knows all about these things. He got blank note forms from the manager
      of the hotel. And he himself dictated the assignment paper to a Japanese
      stenographer. It was astonishing to me to hear him do this; on matters of
      legal phraseology, and where precise statement of fact is required, he is
      very clear-headed. But then, I suppose that my peculiar faculties would be
      equally surprising and interesting to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document worried me a good deal. It is quite long; and it makes over
      to me, in the most unequivocal language, Heloise's entire interest in the
      property. It is worded harshly and sharply. Just reading it, I had the
      unpleasant feeling that I was forcing her to sign away to me everything
      she may possess in the world as security for a paltry loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What's the matter with it?” asked Hindmann, watching my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It has such a horribly ironclad look,” said I. “Then why make her sign
      it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because she'd never in the world accept the money, any other way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said he, very thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look here,” I suggested, “could n't you modify it a little? Make it not
      quite so strong?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. “It's the regular legal form, Eckhart. I've had to do
      this sort of thing half a dozen times.” He smoked a little. “I suppose you
      know it is n't worth a hang.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not worth anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poorest security in the world. It won't be even partly binding until the
      executor of the estate has pledged himself to you to execute the
      agreement, and to accept personal responsibility in the matter. Full of
      holes, that thing is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I did n't dare let him know how my heart jumped at this. I am glad it is
      n't binding. I only wish it did n't look so ugly. I can't bear to think of
      watching her face when she reads it. I fear it will depress her. And she
      will have to struggle to conceal her depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have figured it out that I can spare a thousand dollars from my letter
      of credit now. So that all she will have to do is to sign that document
      and one note for a thousand dollars. Then when I send her the next draft I
      need only enclose a new note for her signature. At Hindmann's suggestion I
      am going to draw each note to run a relatively short time&mdash;a year,
      say. Then I can look after the renewing of them myself, from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thousand dollars that I let her have now will of course have to come
      out of my research money, which is really not mine at all. But at the same
      time that I write Harbury, of the Foundation, to sell my real estate bonds
      and the two railway bonds that are at the Trust Company, I shall ask him
      to notify the Committee that I have diverted this amount for personal use
      and request him to hold back an equal amount from this money of my own
      that he will be sending me, against the draft on my letter of credit.
      Hindmann has drawn up just the paper for me to send Harbury, giving him
      complete power to dispose of the properties for me. Really, I don't know
      what I should have done in all these financial complications without that
      fat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I am very glad of. It is n't going to pinch me at all to do this
      for Heloise. My salary will go right on, of course; and the research fund
      will be there as before. I shan't even have to skimp on hotels and small
      purchases. To tell the truth, I was worried, a little, when I made that
      offer to her the other day. I did n't realize, at the moment, how much
      money I have, and how easy it is to get at. This way, I can look right
      into her eyes and tell her that I shall not be the less comfortable for
      one single hour; and I can tell her with such conviction that she will
      know it for the truth. It won't be nearly so hard for her.

      I'm sending the money too&mdash;in gold&mdash;in a bag. A thousand

      I am sending it to-day because surely she will have little purchases to

      I did not foresee how deeply it would stir me to do this little thing. It

      I got out my black cutaway coat and had it pressed, And the China boy has

    <h2>
      <i>Still the 19th. Very late.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I HAVE been greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was shown into the drawing-room at the Legation residence, the
      Minister himself greeted me. He is a not unattractive man&mdash;past
      middle life, rather stout, with many of the familiar mannerisms of the
      prosperous man of business who has reached a point in life where he feels
      he can afford to indulge and, perhaps, educate the gentler side of his
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose his present position is a reward for generous contributions to
      the expenses of his party. Though I should personally regard it as a
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his lady (a person of some real charm) have surrounded themselves
      with attractive objects of Oriental art. The large rug in the drawing-room
      is as fine an example of Chinese blue and white weaving as I remember
      having seen. I had an opportunity&mdash;when the Minister stepped out of
      the room for a moment, and before the ladies came in&mdash;of turning back
      a corner and counting the threads. They ran twenty and twenty-one to the
      inch, using my thumb-joint as a rough measurement; which is pretty close
      weaving, especially when you consider that the rug is at least sixteen
      feet by twenty-four in size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairs and tables were all of carved blackwood and teak stained black,
      very elaborate, and pleasing in an ornate way. One nest of tables, in the
      corner, was far and away the finest example of Chinese carving I have
      seen, barring small objects of ivory and such, where the work is all on a
      minute scale and therefore more delicate in design and workmanship. There
      were two exquisitely carved wooden screens, and a great number of small
      vases, each on its wooden stand. The most beautiful objects in the room
      were two immense blue and white vases, standing all of seven to eight feet
      high on their pedestals. The Minister says they are of the Ming period.
      And while he did not exactly speak of them in terms of money value, as we
      Americans are prone to do, he did refer casually to another pair, similar
      to these except that the glaze was distinctly inferior, that sold in New
      York for sixteen thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean to give more time to the study of Chinese porcelains later on, when
      settled down in my work, as well as to the history of their painting and
      draw ing. The early musical forms of a people are so inextricably linked
      with all their other folk-habits that one must understand something of all
      of them in order to arrive at a really thorough knowledge of any one.
      Otherwise one would be a mere narrow-rut scientist, like an oculist who
      git es no thought to the general health of a patient or the stomach
      specialist who has no regard for the condition of the teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear I was a little stiff at first, even severe, when tea was served.
      The talk was general. But I could not forget that somewhere on that nan's
      shelves stood von Westfall's work. Of course though, the Minister is the
      merest dilettante. I saw that right away. The sort of man who uses his
      money to build up an atmosphere of understanding and refinement about
      himself, without being altogether successful at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other outsiders had come in, ladies from the hotel, and officers of
      the Legation Guard; and when these rose to go, and of course I with them,
      the Minister asked me to stay. He led me to his office, seated me
      comfortably, and gave me a cigar&mdash;the best cigar, in fact, I have
      smoked since landing at Yokohama. Out here, it is impossible to get much
      besides the rather rank Manila article that comes wrapped in tinfoil. This
      was a real Havana, however, carefully preserved in a humidor. Then he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have known for some time of the work your Foundation is doing in the
      study of primitive music, Dr. Eckhart. And it is, I may say, a subject
      that greatly interests me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not speak what was in my mind. Not yet&mdash;for he had not yet
      thrown that book at my head. It was not yet the time to insult him. It
      would be distinctly unreasonable to insult him at this stage. So I
      inclined my head, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have read some of the older works on the subject of Chinese music&mdash;Van
      Haalst, Elton, Avard, Pegrew, and so on&mdash;and have looked forward
      rather eagerly to the more complete results of modern research. A book was
      recommended to me when I was home last year&mdash;a book by von Westfall,
      of Bonn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I smoked hard and fast. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was recommended as an authoritative work. But I find it, in certain
      respects, quite unsatisfactory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat right up in my chair and stared at him. He continued, rather
      apologetically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course, I am an utter amateur in these matters, Dr. Eckhart. But it is
      disturbing to me to find this supposed authority referring to the twelve
      <i>liis</i> as giving the twelve equal semitones of the octave. Why, that
      is Van Haalst's old error. I know better than that myself. I have sounded
      the <i>liis</i> in the Confucian temple, and they give out very uneven
      intervals, ranging over an octave and a half, at least.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped to my feet and waved my cigar at him. And my voice rang out
      shrilly. I could n't help this; my surprise was so sudden and so complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An octave and three quarters, very nearly,” I cried. “From about our <i>a</i>
      to the <i>f</i> of the second octave above.” And I added, “von Westfall is
      a faker&mdash;a cheap scoundrel masquerading in the robes of the scholar&mdash;a
      man who rushes his guesses into print before the honestly prepared work
      can be completed. He is not an authority. He never was. It is I who am the
      authority. I, and perhaps von Stumbostel, of Berlin. Ask Boag! Ask Ramel,
      Fourmont, de Musseau! Ask Sir Frederick Rhodes, of Cambridge!” And I
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister was impressed. I will say that for him. He got up too, and
      seized my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am delighted,” he said. “You confirm my own rough conclusions. Come
      with me. I have something here that will interest you. At least, I should
      be glad to have your opinion of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into a small room across the hall, unlocking the door with
      a key from his pocket. I followed him in. He raised the window shades,
      then turned with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, against the wall, stood an object the precise like of which I had
      never expected to see outside of the Imperial palace and possibly a temple
      or two at Peking or Nanking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the old stone chimes. The very first glance assured me that
      it was authentic. The stones were all of the same size, shaped roughly
      like the letter L. They hung in a double row, in a carved frame of wood,
      each separate stone suspended by a metal ring&mdash;gold, I think&mdash;that
      pierced the stone at the angle. They were all the same size, of course,
      for the difference of pitch is accounted for by the varying thickness of
      the stones. I counted them; there were sixteen&mdash;the notes of the
      twelve <i>liis</i>, and the first four notes of the grave series.
    </p>
    <p>
      And each of these large stones was a perfect piece of green, translucent
      jade!
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Pien Ch'ing!” I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped forward and examined the stones. They were very old; hard as
      jade is, the corners and edges were worn down here and there. I tapped
      them softly. I simply could not believe my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minister handed me the little wooden mallet that lay at the base. This
      too was very old, though of course a thing of this week as compared with
      the stones. My mind was racing back into dim periods of Chinese history.
      It would be interesting to know where those jade stones have been&mdash;in
      what old royal palaces of Peking, Nanking, Hangchau, Sian-fu&mdash;through
      what wars they have lain buried or have passed from one conquering hand to
      another&mdash;in what stately caravans they may have been transported
      across a swarming, prostrate land. From their appearance they must have
      been in existence long before the destructive hand of the old Emperor Che
      Huang-ti was raised against every book and every instrument of art or
      music in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck the stones, slowly, one after the other But first I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “The intervals will not be perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said he, “for the stones are worn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I struck that old sixteen-note scale again and again. I tested the close
      intervals of the middle section. I listened with my delicate aural nerves
      strained to the uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked excitedly. I fear it was I who said the most. But that was
      natural enough. For I know my subject, and he does not. I told him the
      legend that thousands of years ago a perfect stone chime was found in a
      pool, and that it has since been used to give the correct pitch to all
      Chinese instruments. The known history of the twelve <i>liis</i> gives the
      lie to this, of course; but the legend is quaint. I think I must have
      given him also a rough history of the <i>liis</i>, and of their
      semimythical origin in the life of the prehistoric king who measured off a
      length of bamboo tube with millet grains and produced a tone by sucking
      air through it, and then got his complete scale by cutting other tubes of
      half the size, a quarter the size, and so on. I remember giving him a
      minute explanation of the relation of our piano octave and of the Chinese
      octave to the fixed acoustic laws; and I told him why the Chinese octave
      is flat.... It got dark while we stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally we returned to his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got this Pien Ch'ing, it appears, from a Mandarin shortly after the
      revolution of 1912. He did not give me the details, and of course I did
      not press him; though it would mean a good deal to me to know from what
      palace they were taken, and as much as could be discovered of their
      history. And, for a wonder, he gave me no idea at all of their cost to
      him. Quite apart from their historical value, the jade alone&mdash;sixteen
      very large pieces, of an even green color without a streak or flaw that my
      eye could detect&mdash;is worth a fortune in any market from Peking to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been his dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am exceedingly glad, Dr. Eckhart, that you approve of my purchase. I
      had to use my own judgment, you see. Now let me ask you&mdash;Is not your
      Foundation establishing a museum of ancient musical instruments?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Decidedly we are!” I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pulse was racing like mad; and I know my forehead was sweating, for
      every few minutes, it seems to me, I was wiping my spectacles. Indeed, my
      handkerchief became quite useless for the purpose, and I had to borrow
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the possibilities of this most unexpected situation were dancing in my
      mind at once. What if he should give this treasure to the Foundation... a
      perfect specimen of the basic musical scale of the Eastern World! I could
      not be insensible to the fact that some credit would attach to me, should
      he make the benefaction through me. For this sort of activity is precisely
      the sort that financial directors are peculiarly fitted to understand.
      Scholarship and research worry them a little; they are eager for what they
      call “results.” And if any man in the entire field of musical research has
      ever produced so tangible and valuable a “result” as this ancient and
      perfect Pien Ch'ing, I have yet to learn of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I was thinking of flattering ways in which his name could be
      identified with the gift. For we men of science may be what is called
      “impractical,” but we early learn the proper methods of managing our
      benefactors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, studying me with his eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think, Dr. Eckhart, that the Foundation would regard these stones as
      an acceptable gift?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So acceptable,” said I, “that I should consider it one of the great
      opportunities of my life to act as their representative in the
      transaction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suppose then,” he concluded, “you write me a letter embodying a request
      for the gift, and suggesting the best method of arranging the matter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I meant to return to the hotel. But it proved quite impossible. I was
      altogether too excited for that. Instead, I hailed a rickshaw and drove
      straight for the little hotel near the German <i>glacis</i>. I rushed up
      to Heloise's room, and knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was within, eating a solitary dinner off a tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her of my find. I did n't feel like sitting down, but walked about
      the room as I talked. I described the stones to her. I imitated, as nearly
      as I could with my strident voice, the sound of the stones&mdash;singing
      the scale for her, “Poom!&mdash;poom!&mdash;poom!&mdash;poom-m-m!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise sipped her coffee, and followed me with her eyes. She did n't
      smile very much. To be quite candid, I don't believe she is much
      interested in Pien Ch'ings. Though I realize now that I did break in on
      her abruptly, all full of my triumph, without a thought as to what her
      mood might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come to think of it, I did n't even ask her if she got her traveler's
      checks all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went away rather crestfallen. She suggested that I sit, but I did n't. I
      could n't adjust myself, for some reason. All my life I have dreamed of
      seeing even an incomplete Pien Ch'ing. It was one of my goals in this
      journey. And I don't believe I am altogether to be blamed if the sight of
      a perfect one, the opportunity to tap it with these very hands&mdash;coupled
      with the thought that I am to be the means of bringing it to America and
      placing it within the walls of the institution to which I am devoting
      these best years of my life&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not to be blamed if this experience has stirred me into some
      excitement. It does n't mean that I have forgotten any of the other
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, von Stumbostel himself may have to come to New York to see it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night I am upset. God knows I don't want to disturb Heloise! God
      knows I don't want to give her a moment's extra unhappiness! I would
      gladly bear all her sorrows, if I could.

      Hindmann is helping me draft the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told him about it, he just sat back in his chair and grinned, and
      grinned, and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he knew about the Pien Ch'ing, all the time.

      to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, before my breakfast, I went into the booth to call her up,
      and found that she was at the telephone trying to get me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was n't very nice about your work, yesterday, Anthony. But I didn't
      quite understand at the moment. And you rushed off before I could think.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I protested. I told her how I have been blaming myself for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you are wrong, dear,” she said. “I'm proud and happy for you. I shall
      be expecting a great deal of you, Anthony, when I am away off there in
      Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall expect more of you,” I replied doggedly. Then I broke out&mdash;“I
      want to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But we must n't, Heloise. It's only one day more. Fortunately, we shall
      both be busy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She did n't reply at once. I thought the central operator had cut us off.
      I called, “Hello,” two or three times, and was about to ring for central
      when her voice floated again to my ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Anthony, I'm here. It <i>is</i> fortunate, of course.... You'll come&mdash;at
      least&mdash;in the morning to help me get away?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said I, “I'll come in the morning.” That was all. We said good-by
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sent over a Japanese maid to help with her packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I have followed up the business of the stones all day. I feel
      that I should like to settle this affair before she goes. I want her to
      know that my work is starting so wonderfully well. And doubtless I shall
      hear from the Minister in the morning, the first thing. He has no reason
      to delay. The suggestion came from him, not from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proposing to call the Pien Ch'ing by his name. There are a few other
      perfect or nearly perfect specimens in existence, and a special name is
      desirable. His will do as well as any for the purpose of identifying ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very nervous to-night. Hindmann observed it before I was fully aware
      of it myself. He tried to make me drink some whisky. But I don't see what
      good that would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      These last few days, as I look back on them, seem quite unreal. I walk
      about. I eat. I even sleep. I talk with Hindmann about one thing and
      another, naturally enough. I laugh, I become heated, angry. I even think
      intently of many workaday things. Why, to-day after tiffin, when Hindmann
      made his curious proposal that Heloise and I go into vaudeville under his
      management, I discussed the thing quite rationally before declining&mdash;particularly
      as to the possibility of making her gift of close-interval singing
      intelligible to the ordinary audience.... And yet, nothing is really so.
      Back of it all there is a nervous pressure, a tension....
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it is all over, this strange drama. It has changed me vitally. I
      shall never again be the self-centered&mdash;no, not self-centered, either&mdash;<i>work</i>-centered
      recluse that I have been. Life has seized upon me and whirled me into its
      main current. I have felt passion and jealousy. I have loved. I have
      hated. I have fought. I have held in my arms&mdash;close, close&mdash;the
      one woman whose eyes have the magic power to unlock my heart and flood it
      with the radiant music of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we go our ways&mdash;because it is life. I had her large trunk
      conveyed to the station this afternoon. To-morrow morning I shall call for
      her. We shall step into our separate rickshaws; quiet-seeming folk; I a
      thin man in spectacles and an overcoat and a soft hat; she a slim,
      graceful woman, wearing a simple black suit, slightly pale for want of the
      outdoor air, and with a touch of perplexity and mystery in her shadowy
      blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall ride to the East Station. I will see that she is comfortably
      settled on the train; and wish her a not too unpleasant journey, and stand
      there in the station until the train shall have disappeared beyond the end
      of the Chinese city wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      That will be the end.

      <i>Same date. Night.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> CALLED for
      Heloise at a quarter past nine this morning, and sent up my card.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was returned to me in a few minutes. Heloise had written on it&mdash;“Come
      up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her door was ajar. I stepped in. Her steamer trunk and hand bags were
      piled there, ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be ready in a moment, Anthony,” she said. Then, “You were coming up,
      weren't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She was busy doing a last bit of sewing on her coat, and spoke without
      looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said I, “I was n't.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0359.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      She worked on in silence for a moment. Then she said&mdash;“Do we have to
      go right on, up to the last minute, Anthony, being so dreadfully casual?”
      I hardly knew how to answer this. It had seemed to me that we had to do
      precisely that. I dropped into a chair by the bare center table, and held
      my hat in my two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh. don't worry, Anthony,” she went on. I had never heard her speak in
      just that tone. It disturbed me. “Don't worry. I'm going. To Harbin&mdash;and
      Moscow&mdash;and Paris. In less than an hour I shall be gone. But it did
      seem to me that we could say good-by up here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She went right on sewing until the little task was done. Then she bent
      over and bit off the thread with a jerk of her head. She put the needle in
      her shopping bag; then pursed her lips and studied the little gold watch
      on her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she looked up, and our eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony,” she said, very quietly, “what if I should n't go?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and walked back and forth between the table and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Heloise,” I broke out, “why do you say this now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?” said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can't you see that our judgment is worth nothing now&mdash;nothing at
      all. We've made our plans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you want me to go?” she persisted, her eyes half hidden behind
      drooping lashes, but on me every instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do I want you to go?” I almost mimicked her. My voice was rising, and she
      got up and slipped swiftly past me, closing the door and leaning back
      against it, still watching me. “Do I want to give up the most wonderful
      thing in my life, and turn back, all alone to my work?” I choked. “You
      know better than to ask such a question. It is foolish. You must not say
      such things to me. I can not bear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said she, “why on earth are we doing it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to the chair on the other side of the table and sank into it,
      still watching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are afraid of happiness,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no&mdash;I am not! It is not that!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Anthony, I can't believe that you are afraid of unhappiness. I know
      you too well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not. I am choosing unhappiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She knit her brows. “Probably,” she said slowly and thoughtfully, “it is
      something of both.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” I answered, “you are wrong. You know well enough what it is. It is
      your freedom. That is the one thing I will not, can not take.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My what?” she queried, with a curious, faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your freedom!” I cried, standing over her, with clenched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Anthony, I am not free. There never was a woman less free&mdash;than
      I am&mdash;now&mdash;this minute!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is absurd, Heloise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not absurd. Oh, Anthony, Anthony, will you ever come down out of
      the clouds! Do you really suppose that I will be free just because you say
      so&mdash;off there in Paris, knowing every moment of the day and night
      that nothing on earth but your generosity keeps me alive&mdash;that every
      step of my growth will be due to you&mdash;that&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop, dear! You must not&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “&mdash;that I am not even paying my way? Oh, Anthony, bless your dear
      heart, sometimes, in thinking about you, I laugh&mdash;and sometimes I
      cry. Can't you see that I shall not move a mile toward Paris of my own
      desire, that I go only because you tell me to&mdash;yes, because you order
      me to? Can't you see that this has been your idea all along, not mine&mdash;that
      you have made every decision, down to the minutest detail of my poor
      life.... Freedom? Why, Anthony dear, I'm a million miles from freedom and
      traveling the other way! I don't want that kind of freedom. I want to work
      with you&mdash;right by your side. I want to earn some real freedom, the
      right kind. I want to&mdash;yes, to make good with you, Anthony.... Oh,
      I've tried to be good. I've tried to accept your judgment in everything.
      My life is yours anyway, so there was no harm in that. I love you as I
      never knew a woman could love a man. I worship you.... You must not stop
      me, Anthony!&mdash;Even so, I would give you up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it was best for you. That is all I have asked myself&mdash;What would
      be best for you? And then you've ordered me about so, Anthony, and what on
      earth <i>could</i> I say. I had to plan as you told me to plan. I ought
      not to be saying this now. I ought to be going away, very quietly, saying&mdash;'Yes,
      Anthony. I will go, Anthony.' But now you tell me that in your heart you
      want me to stay. And I can see that it is true. I know you want me.... And
      yet, Anthony, you have the hardihood, you assume the wisdom, to decide for
      us both&mdash;squarely against the dictates of both our hearts. You assume
      not only to decide for us now&mdash;you are deciding what the future would
      be if we should stay together. And that is&mdash;why, that is silly,
      Anthony. There never was a man and woman who needed each other more than
      you and I need each other.” Her voice dropped, and softened. “I don't
      think a man and woman ever loved more wonderfully, Anthony. We are n't
      children. We have suffered. And I think we know.... You see, dear, I have
      come to distrust your judgment about some very human things. Every
      marriage is a risk. People seldom marry who know each other as you and I
      do, who have tested each other.... Oh, I've tried so hard to accept your
      judgment. I kept waking up last night, and it all raced through and
      through my head; and still I felt I must do as you say.”
    </p>
    <p>
      My world was falling about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But your work, child,” I cried. “All that stands just as it stood before,
      when we&mdash;well, when I&mdash;made the plans. The problem is still
      there. We can't escape that, not even by the easy process of following our
      hearts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She had dropped her eyes. She was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is n't any problem, Anthony,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, come, Heloise&mdash;”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is n't, dear. If I spend these next two years just in learning by
      heart the operas that I've got to know, they will be years very well
      invested. I could do that out here as well as in Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you are begging the question, dear. It is n't just that. You know it
      is n't just that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What <i>is</i> just that?” she asked, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to answer this directly. But I had to. I dropped on my knees
      beside her. I gripped her shoulders. I tried to make her look at me. For
      it would not do for us to go all to pieces&mdash;we must face this thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heloise, dear&mdash;you are making me say it, but you knew the problem is
      there. You have not forgotten what those three great singers said?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” she murmured, “I remember well enough.” But still she would not look
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know what they said... the art of the opera singer is the most
      exacting thing in the world. There is no place in it for a husband, a
      home... and children, dear. For these things are exacting, too. It was the
      three greatest sopranos in the world who said that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I know all that, Anthony,”&mdash;I could not make her lift her eyes,&mdash;“but
      people are so different. There is n't any problem, really. There are only
      different persons. That's all, Anthony. I could tell you of three other
      great singers that have husbands, homes and splendid families.... Only one
      thing bothers me&mdash;they all happen to be contraltos. Do you suppose
      there is any such difference as that between contraltos and sopranos,
      Anthony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she looked up. That smile was still hovering about her eyes and the
      corners of her mouth. But when I drew her dear head against my shoulder
      and pressed my lips to her forehead, it faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kissed her eyes, slowly, one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her hand slid hesitatingly upon my shoulder, as it had once before.
      Her head nestled back in the hollow of my arm. I bent close. Our lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said many things. It hardly matters now what they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting this. She held my face in her two hands and looked into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, dear boy,” she said, “you have lived all your life with theories.
      Don't you think it is time you lived with a fact. For I'm afraid that's
      what I am&mdash;a fact. And facts are stubborn things, Anthony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But then she worried a little. “You must n't let me sweep you off your
      feet, Anthony. We must sit up and think. We must decide this thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So she sat up straight. And I leaned back, still kneeling beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little space we were very sober. Then she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anthony! what are you smiling at? What makes you look like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment before I could compose my features. She had folded her
      hands in her lap. Her eyes followed mine to the watch on her wrist as I
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your train left the East Station sixteen minutes ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew her under lip in a little way between her teeth, as I had seen
      her do so many times when she was startled. Then, “Oh, Anthony!” she said,
      laughing a little&mdash;“the big trunk has gone with it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall get the trunk back all right. It was just a matter of
      telegraphing Tientsin. The baggage master here attended to it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The refunding of Heloise's ticket money proves to be a more complicated
      matter. There is no Public-Service Commission to direct the Trans-Siberian
      in such matters&mdash;nothing but the Russian and Chinese Governments.
      Hindmann thinks that they may be willing to give back half of it. He says
      that is a common rule among the big steamship companies. Half the railway
      fare, that is; there will be no refunding of what was paid for the berth,
      of course. Anyway, Hindmann has taken the ticket and says he can probably
      get something done within the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I find it difficult to take this matter seriously. I could
      cheerfully let the money go. But Heloise, I can see, is a little disturbed
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We discussed the question of a marriage, this afternoon, she and I. We
      both want some sort of ceremony. Mainly, I suppose, for the effect on
      ourselves. And since we are here, with nothing to do but go ahead with our
      work and our lives, neither Heloise nor I can see any sound reason for
      delaying. If we were back home, or if she were among friends, it might be
      well to wait. Though I doubt even that. It would be merely a conventional
      observance, and would serve no healthy purpose. No, our job now is to go
      straight ahead with the life that we are to share. And we may as well be
      about it. So we shall be married, quietly and soberly, sometime within the
      next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had thought of the Consulate. But some telephoning on the part of
      Hindmann drew out the information that our consular and diplomatic
      officials are not permitted to solemnize marriages, nor to advise
      regarding the legality of the arrangements. The Consul-General is willing
      to witness the ceremony officially, but we should have to go down to
      Tientsin for that, and we both want to be married here in Peking if it is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar complication is, of course, that China, as an Oriental,
      non-Christian country, does not solemnize marriages in any way that is
      recognized in the West. If we were in a European country now, all that
      would be necessary would be to conform to local customs. But international
      observances, as among Western peoples, do not hold where China is
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Hindmann said,
    </p>
    <p>
      “What's the matter with a missionary brother?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, of course!” replied Heloise. “Aren't we stupid? They are ministers.
      And I don't think it matters what particular place they happen to be in
      when they say the words.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindmann is inclined to think that we had best go down after all to the
      Tientsin Consulate and be married there, either by a missionary or by a
      minister of one of the Settlements. “There's several thousand white folks
      there,” said he. “Pretty sure to be some preachers among 'em. Then, you
      see, the Consul-General will give you each a certificate, and besides
      he'll have the marriage put on record at the State Department at
      Washington. That way, it 'll hold all right, I guess.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise and I covertly exchanged glances. We know what is in our hearts
      Certificates!...

    <h2>
      <i>On the Steamer, “Hsing Mien,”, Yangtze River. May 1st.</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> FOUND this volume
      of my journal to-day at the bottom of my trunk. I do not understand why I
      wrote it. My life is so astonishingly different now. Yet for many years I
      rarely missed a day. In the earlier volumes&mdash;left in my tin trunk, at
      Peking, with my other books and papers&mdash;each little step of the
      laborious, day-by-day work that has so slowly brought me to my present
      mastery of my subject, is carefully noted down. I rarely noted mere moods,
      conversations, personal interests, until this journey to the East. I am
      amazed, in turning the leaves of this latest and (I think) last volume, to
      observe that it is almost wholly personal. But I suppose this is natural,
      considering the extraordinarily personal nature of the events in which I
      have played so curious and, in the outcome, so wonderful a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think I shall make any effort to keep it up. It was the companion
      of my solitary years. There is no longer the inclination&mdash;or even the
      time. I have a better companion. Why, I hardly realized, until this
      afternoon, that it has been all but forgotten for ten days. Since my
      eighteenth birthday, when I began my series of journals in earnest, I have
      never before neglected this work for a greater space than three days.
      Excepting, of course, when I was operated upon, four years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards my working notes, Heloise insists on keeping those herself. She
      has discarded the journal method as cumbersome and difficult to index. She
      has ordered a series of loose-leaf blank books from Kelly and Walsh, at
      Shanghai. Meantime she is keeping all my memoranda on cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is rather a surprise to me that I can permit her to rearrange my habits
      of work in this fashion. But I do permit it. I am even forced to admit
      that she is already an invaluable assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She says that she wants to help all she can in my work now, while it is
      possible. Later there will be complications of one sort or the other. She
      is right at her own work, too; but that, she says, is fun. And she
      practices every day. I observe her, from hour to hour and day to day, in a
      curious sort of wonder. It will be some time, I see, before I shall really
      grow to accept it all as fact. I am living in a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This steamer is a large, modern affair, with electric lights and a very
      fair table. We are going down to Nanking&mdash;three days from Hankow. We
      came to Hankow by rail from Peking; an interesting journey, and not
      uncomfortable, barring the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanking has been recommended to me as a center of much of the traditional
      musical culture of China. And as the Yangtze Valley, they say, becomes
      unbearably hot in the summer-time, we thought it advisable to spend a few
      weeks there before the worst of the heat sets in. Also, there is some talk
      that another revolution may break out there, later on. From there we go on
      to Shanghai for a period of study; then, doubtless, back to Peking and
      Tientsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Yangtze proves rather disappointing, scenically. So far, the
      banks have been flat and muddy most of the way. And the water is yellow

      But the junks are interesting, with their high timbered sterns and the
      brown sails with bamboo ribs. Too, I rather like the water buffalo that
      stand knee deep near the banks and sullenly watch us as we plow
      majestically by. And the river ports, of course, are quite fascinating.
      The water beggars paddle out in sampans and large round tubs, and bold up
      baskets on the ends of bamboo poles in which we of the regal upper deck
      are supposed to deposit brass cash and small silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been writing this on the long table in the room that is at once
      social hall and dining-room for the first cabin passengers. Chinese “boys”
      slip about in their soft shoes. At the farther end of the table the second
      engineer&mdash;a Scotchman, of course&mdash;is playing Sousa records on
      the talking machine that is his chiefest treasure in this lonely land. He
      is entertaining a bearded English globe-trotter and an American military
      man. I can't recall the name of this latter, though we met at the Legation
      in Peking. We always bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heloise has just come from our stateroom. She has taken the seat opposite,
      and is watching me as I write. She is smiling a little. I know this,
      though I will not look up. Not until I finish. For once my eyes rest on
      hers, my pen will stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what she wants. It is near the sunset hour. She likes me to be out
      on deck with her then, and at moonrise. She feels these wonders in some
      deep corner of her nature. She always becomes very silent, and presses
      close against my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can feel her eyes on me. I shall not be able to hold out much longer. I
      want to laugh, and you can not write to any purpose when you are
      laughing....
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I shall not write any more.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
